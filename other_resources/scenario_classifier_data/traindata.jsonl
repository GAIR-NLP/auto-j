{"category": "default", "instruction": "Brainy Dose Presents: 12 Ways Chronic Fear Is Harming Your Health Fear is a natural human emotion that kicks in when you sense a threat and causes your body to respond with a fight or flight response. Fear helps keep you safe. But when it becomes chronic and consumes you, day in and day out, it can be debilitating. Chronic fear is when the stress response gets stuck in the \u201con\u201d position and the body never gets a chance to return to homeostasis (the state of equilibrium in which all systems function normally).\n\nThis can lead to mental and physical health issues.\n\n In this video, we explore how chronic fear affects you and what you can do to break free from it and get back on track. Number 1 - It Weakens Your Immune System Your immune system is designed to protect you from bacteria, viruses, and other foreign invaders. It also helps heal wounds and fight infections. However, chronic fear can weaken this natural defense mechanism. And that\u2019s because fear causes your body to release a flood of stress hormones, including cortisol and adrenaline.\n\n When your body is exposed to these hormones for a prolonged period of time, its ability to fight against viruses, infections, and other illnesses is compromised. This leaves you more susceptible to illness. Number 2 - It Can Lead to Cognitive Dysfunction If you\u2019re living with chronic fear, your mind is constantly racing with negative thoughts about the future and what might go wrong.\n\nThus, it can be hard to focus on anything else. The fight or flight instinct causes you to lose your ability to concentrate which, in turn, can affect your daily activities.\n\n This means having trouble thinking clearly, remembering things, paying attention to details, and solving problems. Additionally, fear can lead to a decline in motivation and energy, further impairing your cognitive functioning. Number 3 - It Can Cause Anxiety and Panic Attacks When you have chronic fear, it can lead to an increase in anxiety and panic attacks. Anxiety is characterized by a feeling of worry or uneasiness that may be accompanied by physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, sweating, and muscle tension. Panic attacks are periods of intense fear or terror that occur suddenly and without warning.\n\nDuring a panic attack, you may feel like you\u2019re losing control or going crazy. You might even feel like you\u2019re having a heart attack or going to die. Number 4 - It Can Prevent You from Relaxing When you\u2019re afraid, it can be hard to relax. Your heart beats faster, and your body goes into fight-or-flight mode; you\u2019re just not able to calm down. Chronic fear also makes it hard for you to get a good night\u2019s rest.\n\n First, it makes it difficult for you to unwind at the end of the day; and second, it can make you more likely to have nightmares. This combination often leads to insomnia. Number 5 - It Impairs Digestion The same hormones that cause the body to tense up and go into fight or flight mode, also disrupt the normal digestion process. This causes the digestive system to slow down and be less efficient, decreasing overall nutrient absorption.\n\nFurthermore, fear can cause an increase in acid production, resulting in stomach pains and indigestion.\n\n Number 6 - It Can Cause Premature Aging The stress of chronic fear can make your skin look old and wrinkled due to all that excess cortisol. Cortisol affects the production of collagen (the main component of skin that affects its elasticity and suppleness). Too much cortisol can break down collagen faster than it can be replaced, leading to wrinkles, dry and dull skin, age spots, and other signs of premature aging. Number 7 - It Can Deplete Your Confidence Levels Confidence is an integral part of self-esteem and well-being. It gives you the ability to face the day with positivity, knowing that you can handle whatever comes your way.\n\n But when fear takes over, it can be hard to feel confident in yourself or your abilities. You may also feel like you\u2019re constantly trying to prove yourself to others, and this leads to feelings of inadequacy. Number 8 - It Might Lead to Avoiding Things That Are Good for You When you are afraid of something, naturally, you try to avoid it.\n\nThis can be a good strategy if the thing you\u2019re afraid of is dangerous. But when it comes to chronic fear, avoidance can make your life worse because it also prevents you from doing things that are good for you and could help you feel better.\n\n For example, you might not go to the doctor when you feel sick because you\u2019re afraid of what they might discover; or you may avoid new experiences out of fear of getting hurt.\n\nNumber 9 - It Disrupts Hormone Levels When you have chronic fear, cortisol levels remain elevated, triggering a cascade of physiological changes that disrupt the delicate balance of hormones in the body. This disruption can lead to increased levels of catecholamines, which can further heighten feelings of anxiety and fear. Additionally, chronically elevated cortisol levels can interfere with the production of hormones like progesterone, estrogen, and testosterone, causing a variety of health issues, such as infertility, low libido, and adrenal fatigue.\n\nNumber 10 - It Can Cause You to Develop Phobias If your fear often revolves around the same objects or situations, over time, this fear can become a phobia.\n\n When this happens, you may be afraid of anything that is related to the original triggers. Phobias can be debilitating and can have a significant impact on your life. You may find yourself avoiding certain places or activities that trigger your fear, leading to a diminished quality of life. Number 11 - It Can Trigger Depression When you\u2019re constantly worrying about what could go wrong, it\u2019s no surprise that chronic fear can trigger depression. It\u2019s like you\u2019re constantly weighed down by a heavy burden that you can\u2019t seem to shake.\n\n You feel overwhelming sadness, moodiness, and fatigue, all of which can be debilitating. You may also find yourself unable to engage in activities you once enjoyed, and it can also affect your relationships. Number 12 - It Causes Cardiovascular Damage Chronic fear can cause cardiovascular damage as a result of the body\u2019s increased production of stress hormones, which lead to elevated heart rate and blood pressure, causing a strain on the heart muscles.\n\nOver time, this also causes a rise in cholesterol levels and fatty deposits in the arteries, resulting in atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. This restricts blood flow to the heart, and can cause a heart attack or stroke.\n\n Long-term chronic fear can also cause changes in the heart\u2019s electrical signals, raising your risk of abnormal heart rhythms. When living with chronic fear, it\u2019s important to understand that the fear is not necessarily rational or logical. It\u2019s simply a feeling that you can\u2019t shake. It can be overwhelming and can prevent you from taking risks and engaging in activities that could be beneficial for you.\n\nThe good news is that there are ways to manage chronic fear.\n\n First and foremost, it\u2019s important to understand that it\u2019s OK to feel scared. Acknowledge and accept your fear, and then take small steps to face it. Just be patient and gentle with yourself during this process. It can also be helpful to reach out to a mental health professional if your fear is affecting your daily life. They can help you address the root cause of your fear and provide guidance on how to manage it.\n\n Talking to trusted friends and family can be beneficial as well. After all, it\u2019s important to have a support network that you can turn to when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed.

For any given person who completes the Pulse, they complete a 10-minute survey where they reflect on their recent performance and score themselves from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree on behavioural questions. The behavioural question cover SaaS sales skills like Negotiation, Time Management and Planning, Objection Handling and Rapport and Relationship Building, softer skills like Growth Mindset and Drive and Internal Supportiveness, and knowledge areas like Product Acumen and Market Acumen.\n3. Their manager also completes a shorter 3-minute review of each team member\n4. The results are combined to build a 'profile' for each team member. The profile identifies their strengths and weaknesses, taking into account both the team member and manager review, blindspots (gaps between team member and manager opinion).\n5. The team member receives development recommendations on how they can improve \n\nSome benefits for the team member:\n1. They will find out which competencies they should develop to close more deals\n2. Their skillset is benchmarked against the SaaS industry so they can see how they compare\n3. They can have better 1:1s with their manager as it provides structure\n\nFor the manager:\n1. They get a diagnostic review of their teams performance and can uncover gaps in competency / drops in team motivation\n2. It takes them very little time to get a lot of qualitative data on their team\n3. The qualitative insights are a leading indicator of team performance, compared to the lagging quantative metrics taken from the CRM\n4. They can build better, more targeted and personalised development plans for their team members\n5. They can run better, data-driven 1:1s\n6. Their team can be coached to close more deals / hit their quota\n\nSome concerns we need to overcome:\n1. We need to make it seem like the easiest thing in the world to do as sales people are impatience\n2. We need to make it seem very fun and very valuable, as if they would be really missing out if they didn't do this\n\nI need your helping preparing information for this one-pager.

I don't know the exact percentage. But consumption and usage is probably one of the faster growing gotomarket revenue models. Within our customer base. Even the sas space I'm thinking about customers I've worked with. Mongodb. Who when we were selling into that account, they were moving from kind of a perpetual. To. You know, sas business, but also within that model, they're moving from, you know, upfront contracts to more of a consumption play. So they wanted to represent kind of all four of those data points within their forecast and clarity. And they actually had the actual. Rolling up in salesforce. So we were able to bring that in. Stephen and I can work on I guess a more formal response on like, hey, here. Here are three customers with a similar model. And. I think what would be really interesting is. Once you once you share with us your vision. If you want to Chuck over that email. Once we understand a little more about how you'd like to represent the data, then we could based on what our customers are doing today, we can help you guys figure out how to set things up in Salesforce. And create that more robust process. But. Short answer is I don't know the exact percent, but we definitely have customers. You know with consumption models or hybrid models in clarity. They're rolling that data up in the forecast. The Ai predictability.\n\n>>Curt Weaver 42:36\nPiece is a bit it's a bit trickier with consumption revenue. But our customers that are doing consumption are rolling it up in a forecast, which is similar to what I just shared the screenshot that I just shared where you can roll the data up in a forecast and then let the sales teams call a number. So. Hey. I said we were gonna do this. Three months ago, and. How my perspective is changed or is the same and they call that number so that the data is their opinion on the business is represented. And that enables you or the sales leadership team to forecast more accurately because they get kind of up to date number in terms of things calling.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 43:23\nIn terms of the AI predictability piece.\n\n>>Curt Weaver 43:27\nI would assume it doesn't affect.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 43:32\nIt doesn't affect what we were showed last week by Stephen in terms of like if predicting if it's going to close or not, surely that piece is same. It's the second half where it obviously has to work like three times as hard to try and figure out whether or not that revenue is going to come actually start ramping and coming through which I think we're okay with that. By the way.\n\n>>Curt Weaver 43:54\nThat's a dream state.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 43:55\nBut I think we're I think we can accept the fact that, like. Have to be realistic about like you know where we are now and where we want to be. This year. I don't think that would hit the roadmap. That would just be a pipe dream for us.\n\n>>Curt Weaver 44:13\nBut if it has some capabilities around that as well.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 44:16\nThen, awesome.\n\n>>Stephen Donohoe 44:22\nRight conscious effort. We're just up on time. I suppose a next step from here, then thanks for. And for the other context, lizzym, I suppose the next step from here is, yep. We'd love to get our hands on that kind of dream state for you. How you'd like to visualize things. We can start then to think about a few ways that you can represent that in clarion and present that back to you. The other thing that would be good for us to go through is and I know we alluded to it. I believe on the first call, but even just for the traditional, more kind of pure place SaaS side of the business. We still want to make sure that we're doing the right amount of technical due diligence upfront to make sure that we are going to be able to work with your current Salesforce environment. It's 99% of the time it's never an issue. But no two salesforces are created equally so you never know sometimes there are pretty hairy, complex setups. What would be great? As if we could pencil in some time, I'll send you over a mutual nondisclosure agreement right after this call. Have a look at a pretty standard. Sas? Mnda. It should be pretty straightforward to get that sorted, but it'd be great if we could have a look at the Salesforce setup on your end as well, specifically around Roll hierarchy, the Opportunity module. Or sorry. Object. I should say set up and a couple of other pieces just so that we can check that box internally to say yes, this is all good. We can actually work with this Salesforce environment really easily. Second to that it allows us and to provide a lot more guidance and be more specific around what does implementation look like both in terms of a cost and also in terms of a lift.\n\n>>Stephen Donohoe 46:03\nWe usually set aside. About an hour for that. And we don't always need it. 40 minutes might be enough. But if there's a bunch of Q amp a sometimes it can take the full error. I'll start kind of ranting there for a moment to get your thoughts. And then if there's time, maybe we could look to schedule that in.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 46:22\nYeah, of course. If you can get me the Nda like today or tomorrow, hopefully we can get that 20 minutes. Technically, I need to flip it's illegal, which is annoying. So let's just say we get it signed by the end of the week. So can we schedule something in now for, like, early next week. To take that call, and by then we should definitely have the. Nda sign. I'm assuming there's no red lines or anything that we need to change. But I'm just worst case scenario in it that we might need to.\n\n>>Stephen Donohoe 46:54\nYeah, that's fine. Usually it gets usually it goes through pretty quickly. I have had one instance where there was a very, very particular business that had on a red lines on the Nda, which I'd never even seen because maybe I figured document, but. We can work with you if that's the case, but it usually goes through pretty quickly.\n\n>>Lizy Thomson 47:17\nIn the meeting as well, since it's. Salesforce.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 47:21\nYeah, we would need Sara as well.\n\n>>Stephen Donohoe 47:26\nKurt is a is a similar time. I may even just like lean on both of you because I know in Dubai you're obviously 4 hours ahead of the Uk Eastern time, I think is 5 hours behind. So there's like this kind of window around. When we started this call that might work for everybody. But is there any days next week that we should avoid if it's a similar time.\n\n>>Curt Weaver 47:50\nMonday? No. Go ahead.\n\n>>Lizy Thomson 47:53\nSorry. The Salesforce admin works in India, so that's another one and a half hours ahead. So we'll have to consider that too.\n\n>>Stephen Donohoe 48:07\nWhat's the ideal time.\n\n>>Curt Weaver 48:11\nSee if I can make that work.\n\n>>Lizy Thomson 48:19\nIn the Optinum.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 48:21\nYeah. I think that would be too early for cut. I think even like, 30 minutes before.\n\n>>Lizy Thomson 48:27\nWe started today.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 48:28\nWould help. But if not, it's fine. We'll ask it to join. It's. Okay.\n\n>>Lizy Thomson 48:33\nSo if you want to do same time I'm sure she could.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 48:36\nShe could log on quickly.\n\n>>Curt Weaver 48:38\nI'd say same time or 30 minutes earlier. Would work on Tuesday, next week. Yeah.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 48:45\nThat would work. That will work for me. Yeah, I can do that.\n\n>>Lizy Thomson 48:55\nYeah.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 48:58\nIn place as well.\n\n>>Stephen Donohoe 49:01\nOkay.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 49:03\nWe'll also try and can't promise but try and drive it forward so that we can get you that. Kind of. Ideal. Framework that we want when we think about forecasting. So we try and get that done this week as well. And over to you guys.\n\n>>Curt Weaver 49:22\nThen yeah, hopefully.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 49:25\nHopefully. Then we'll be able to have a good discussion next week. So is next week on Tuesday. Is that just looking at the Salesforce instance, or you also wanted to dive into anything else.\n\n>>Stephen Donohoe 49:36\nAll right. Anything outside of that, that would be helpful. To kind of lock through maybe if a peak at how you're currently forecasting, if that's outside of Salesforce. Nothing else comes to mind for me but, Kurt, you're probably best based on for that.\n\n>>Curt Weaver 49:49\nYeah. Let's say any kind of key manual reports that you're looking for clarity. To automate or help automate. That would help, but mainly it's Salesforce. Roll, hierarchy, opportunities, accounts, things like that and then. Anything you're doing today around forecasting and reporting that you are hopeful clarine can help with.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 50:15\nI'll let this take that one. She's the one that fills the pain on that.\n\n>>Stephen Donohoe 50:24\nVice. I guess that Nda over to you. Give me about 20 minutes at most. Nathan, I'll send it to you as well so that you both have it in your inbox. If there's any questions or feedback on it, just let me know and hopefully it's pretty quick. And then we can reconnect again next Tuesday. I'm around as well for the rest of this week. We've still got another four days in the week. If there's anything else that you want to work through in terms of workflows or use cases, let me know I'm more than happy to kind of just jump on a 30 minutes call and look at a few different use cases inside of clarity as well. If there's anything that you feel we haven't covered often as much detail as you be comfortable with, so do let me know. On us. Yeah more than happy to.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 51:04\nOkay. We might do that. Actually, obviously, I'm gonna try and speak with Johnathan. But it'd be also good to just. I think just do 30 minutes and just kind of understand. Like. From a text act perspective. And maybe it's probably beneficial, but I speak with Jonathan first, but. Like when we talk about buying clarity. If we're not just take Wingman Wingman out of it for a second. Like what else is it we're buying and how much will reps use it versus. US just using it as like a forecasting solution, if that makes sense, because that's just something we're a bit sensitive to in terms of, like the amount of new platforms that we're rolling out recently. Then it might get very confusing it to a wrap of, like, what the hell? Now I have to go into clarity as well. I thought I was managing my deals in Outreach, for example. Right.\n\n>>Curt Weaver 51:59\nSo it'd be good to just look at that piece.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 52:01\nBut maybe I can look at Jonathan's camera than now. Ideally I'd like to speak to him first and say, like, you know, how are you guys using it? And then I'll be more inform when we speak. He's obviously not using the Outreach Integrated calendar. So you send me a cavernley invite? So.\n\n>>Lizy Thomson 52:27\nYou did mention that Jonathan was using Outreach to Munch the top level of the funnel right of the pipeline. Okay. Yeah.\n\n>>Stephen Donohoe 52:40\nSo, I mean, he can provide more context there. That's what the account team here. Shared with me, and Johnny confirmed that with me. But I didn't have an indepth discussion about everything I was using outreach, so there might be some nuance there. And if when you speak to them that he can share. But yeah, top of funnel, they are doing an outreach. They're using kaya for their conversation intelligence. And then they're using clarity from a Deal Management forecasting. Sales on a lithics perspective. On salesforce as a CRM.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 53:16\nSo I'm booking in for Wednesday. As that's the earliest thought that you've got there was no starts tomorrow. Do you have any. Time on Thursday, Stephen, for just like 30 minutes.\n\n>>Stephen Donohoe 53:33\nYeah, I can. I'm pretty flexible on Thursday, to be honest, so I can do a little bit earlier, if that's better for you as well. Just let me know our time works. I can make it work. And the only stuff I have in there at this stage until later in the afternoon is kind of internal stopping, and we shifted around.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 53:51\nDo you have anything at 10:00 A.M. Your time.\n\n>>Stephen Donohoe 53:53\nYeah. Is that good? Yeah, yeah, that's perfect. Jeff. Teresa. Second. Oh. Yes. So I'm just hanging on flying back to Ireland on Thursday morning, but I think I landed Ace. So I'll definitely be home and set off by ten. Yes, that should be fine. Barring any catastrophe with flights getting canceled. And if that does happen, I'll send you texture an email. In the morning. Just let you know, but that shouldn't be an issue.\n\n>>Nathan Seldon 54:20\nOkay. No worries. Yeah. If that. If that is the case. I've got some space. At 06:00 P.M. My time which would be like 02:00 P.M..\n\n>>Stephen Donohoe 54:28\nSo okay, cool. Hopefully it doesn't come to that and the flight goes off without a hitch And Yeah, I'll be well home and set up by ten so that's fine. Alright enough. Thanks so much everyone And I know we've fallen on for an extra few minutes so appreciate being facts above the time there. Thank you Karris. I'll stand out an invite for that. This Thursday, and also next Tuesday, and that Nda then will be with you shortly as well. Anything else you need? Just let me know.\n\n>>Lizy Thomson 54:53\nAwesome really appreciate the guy.\n\n>>Stephen Donohoe 54:56\nAwesome. Thank you, everyone. Goodbye.\"", "input": ""}

{"category": "default", "instruction": "Hello chatpt I'm working on a game design document for my weapon system. Please review the following and let me know if you understand the system.\n\nWeapon System\nIn our game, the weapon system allows players to arm themselves with a variety of tools for combat. These weapons each have their own unique move sets and abilities, which the player can use to attack enemies and defend themselves. As the player progresses through the game, they will unlock new weapons to add to their arsenal. In addition, players can enhance their weapons by socketing Manacite into them, giving them additional skills and passive effects. This allows players to adapt to different combat situations and use different Mana types in their attacks strategically.\n\nWeapon Types\nWeapon Unlock Method\nDaggers Tutorial\nSword & Shield Tutorial\nBows Tutorial\nSpears Tutorial\nManaball Tutorial\nTwinblades Story Progression\nFists Story Progression\nFlails Story Progression\nGunbrella Story Progression\nManamasher Story Progression\nWeapon Mechanics\nTo attack with their weapons, players press the primary attack key, which triggers a seamless animation of the weapon's move set. The player can also use a modifier key to modify an attack in progress, depending on the Manacite socketed into the weapon. To switch between different Mana types, players use the scroll key to cycle through their available options. This allows players to adapt to different combat situations and use their weapons in a variety of ways.\n\nWhen a player attacks with their weapon, they charge the Manacite bar associated with the Mana type they are currently using. For example, if a player is using a weapon with Blue Mana, attacking with that weapon will charge the Blue Manacite bar. If the player is using Neutral Mana, attacking with the weapon will charge all Manacite bars equally. When the Manacite bar is fully charged, the player can use the Modifier key to activate the most fully charged Manacite ability. The abilities are arranged on the bar in the same order they were socketed, and the player can activate them by pressing the Modifier key. This allows players to strategically use their Manacite abilities in combat to gain an advantage over their enemies.\n\nManacite\nManacite are consumable items that can be socketed into weapons to give them additional skills or passive effects, up to a maximum of 5. When socketed into a weapon, Manacite allows the weapon to make attacks in the Neutral Mana type and the Mana types of the Manacite socketed. For example, if a weapon has 2 Green and 3 Blue Manacite socketed, that weapon will be able to make attacks in Neutral, Green, and Blue mana types. To change Mana types, the player scrolls to cycle through their available types. Using the same example, if the player has their weapon set to Blue mana, they will have access to the Blue bonuses provided by the (3) blue Manacite. To use the (2) Green bonuses socketed, the player must cycle the weapon to the Green Mana type. Cycling Mana types on a weapon is intended to be completed both in-combat and out-of-combat as the player adapts to the situation.\n\nNPC Types\nNPC\nInnkeeper\nBlacksmith\nRanger\nFisher\nArtificer\nSummary\nOverall, the weapon system in the game offers players a range of options for combat, allowing them to tailor their playstyle and strategy to the situation at hand. The ability to unlock new weapons and enhance them with Manacite allows players to adapt and evolve their strategy as they progress through the game.", "input": ""}

The data set consists of over 49K records with 14 attributes with missing data.\n\n```ludwig datasets download adult\\_census\\_income```\nThis command will create a dataset adult\\_census\\_income.csv in the current directory.\n\nThe columns in the dataset are\n\ncolumn description\nage numeric variable, age of person\nworkclass categorical variable, Type of empolyment\nfnlwgt numeric variable, no defintion\neducation categorical variable, education level\neducation-num nmeric variable, no definition\nmarital-status categorical variable, marital status\noccupation categorical variable, occupation\nrelationship categorical variable, Relationship to household\nrace categorical variable, race\nsex categorical variable, gender\ncapital-gain numeric variable, no definition\ncapital-loss numeric variable, no definition\nhours-per-week numeric variable, hours worked per week\nnative-country categorical variable, Country of origin\nincome binary variable, \" <=50K\" or \" >50K\"\nsplit numeric variable, indicating data split training(0), test(2)\n\nTrain\nThe Ludwig configuration file describes the machine learning task. There is a vast array of options to control the learning process. This example only covers a small fraction of the options. Only the options used in this example are described. Please refer to the Configuration Section for all the details.\n\nFirst, the defaults section defines the global preprocessing options. All numeric features are z-scored normalized, i.e., mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation. Numeric missing values are filled in with the mean of non-missing values.\n\nThe input\\_features section describes each of the predictor variables, i.e., the column name and type of input variable: number or category\n\nThe 'combiner' section defines how the input features are combined to be passed to the output decoder. This example uses the concat combiner, which simply concatenates the output of the input feature encoders. The combined data is passed through a three layer fully connected network of 128 cells in each layer with dropout regularization.\n\nNext the output\\_features are defined. In this example, there is one response variable called income. This is a binary feature with two possible values: \" <=50K\" or \" >50K\". Because thes values are not conventional binary values, i.e., \"True\" and \"False\", a feature specific preprocessing option is specified to indicate which string (\" >50K\") is interpreted as \"True\". A four layer fully connected decoder of 32 cells in each layer is specified for this output feature.\n\nThe last section in this configuration file describes options for how the the trainer will operate. In this example the trainer will process the training data for 10 epochs. The optimizer type is \"adam\".\n```\ndefaults:\n number:\n preprocessing:\n normalization: zscore\n missing\\_value\\_strategy: fill\\_with\\_mean\n\ninput\\_features:\n - name: age\n type: number\n - name: workclass\n type: category\n - name: fnlwgt\n type: number\n - name: education\n type: category\n - name: education-num\n type: number\n - name: marital-status\n type: category\n - name: occupation\n type: category\n - name: relationship\n type: category\n - name: race\n type: category\n - name: sex\n type: category\n - name: capital-gain\n type: number\n - name: capital-loss\n type: number\n - name: hours-per-week\n type: number\n - name: native-country\n type: category\n\noutput\\_features:\n - name: income\n type: binary\n preprocessing:\n fallback\\_true\\_label: \" >50K\"\n decoder:\n num\\_fc\\_layers: 4\n output\\_size: 32\n\ntrainer:\n epochs: 10\n optimizer:\n type: adam\n```\n\nTrain the model.\n\n```\n# Trains the model.

No body talked to them.\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : Good morning Elon, Just wanted to check-in and see when your team would be able to start sending us information and perhaps have a kickoff call with our International Investments Team. If Sam can organize, that would be great. Best, Yasir\n\nElon Musk : Please refute this false statement that PIF has no interest in Tesla. This is outrageous.\n\nElon Musk : I am deeply offended\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-12/saudi-fund-is-said-to-be-in-talks-to-invest-in-tesla-buyout-deal\n\nElon Musk : This is an extremely weak statement and does not reflect the conversation we had at Tesla. You said you were definitely interested in taking Tesla private and had wanted to do so since 2016. You also made it clear that you were the decision-maker, moreover backed strongly by the Crown Prince, who regards this as strategically important at a national level.\n\nElon Musk : I\u2019m sorry, but we cannot work together\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : It\u2019s up to you Elon\n\nElon Musk : You are throwing me under the bus\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : It takes two to tango We haven\u2019t received any thing yet\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : Let\u2019s get on the phone and discuss\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : Are available now\n\nElon Musk : Sorry\n\nElon Musk : It\u2019s over\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : Let\u2019s see the numbers and get our people to meet and discuss. We cannot approve something that we don\u2019t have sufficient information on. We\u2019ve agreed that you will send the financial information and the way going forward within a week and no thing happened since. The last thing I want to do is the \u201cthrough you under the bus\u201d I am your friend. So, please don\u2019t treat me like an enemy. I\u2019m willing to fly to you or we can meet somewhere in Europe and discuss a constructive next steps.\n\nElon Musk : Tesla is a publicly traded company and there is detailed information in our earnings newsletter and Q&A afterwards\n\nElon Musk : You bought 5% based on that\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : Details on how we can take the company private\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : That\u2019s what we agreed on\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : What is the required percentage and so on\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : What are required regulatory thresholds for taking it private\n\nElon Musk : Yasir, when we met at Tesla recently, you said that you were the decision-maker for PIF, that you had wanted to do the Tesla take-private deal for two years, and that this was supported directly by the Crown Prince. I checked with my team who were in that meeting in case I remembered something wrong and they confirmed this exactly.\n\nElon Musk : You are extremely experienced financially and are well-aware of what a go-private would require, which is that there would need to be at least a 20% premium to market in order to buy out any shareholders who don\u2019t want to remain part of the company when it is private. This is all standard practice. Nothing unusual at all.\n\nElon Musk : There are many other investment funds who want to be part of this deal. We do not need your fund to get this done. I will not work with an organization who\u2019s public statement to the media do not match their private statements to me and my team.\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : We haven\u2019t taken any company private yet in the us or any where els and the agreement as was minuted by my people is to wait for the information to be sent be you within a week, on how we will move forward to gather.\n\nElon Musk : Please extend an offer to the Crown Prince that I would like to apologize personally and explain why Tesla will not with PIF in this transaction.\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : We haven\u2019t gone to the media yet\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : Read the article please\n\nElon Musk : I read the article. It is weak sauce and still makes me sound like a liar. It is filled with equivocation and in no way indicates the strong interest you conveyed in person.\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : Let\u2019s meet ASAP. Please let me know what works for you\n\nElon Musk : I am sorry, but there will be no further communication unless you fix the public perception of wishy washy support and interest from PIF. That is not what you said to me and my team privately. Someone is either a friend or not a friend and no friend says one thing privately and another thing publicly. This is not right.\n\nElon Musk : In light of these actions and nothing meaningful done to correct them, Tesla will be moving forward with Silver Lake, Goldman and other investors to take Tesla private.\n\nElon Musk : Please let them know if you wish to retain or sell your current position in Tesla\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : I will ask Shihana to call Sam so they can work on PIF statement.\n\nElon Musk : Thank you. This means a great deal.\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : \ud83d\ude4f\nAugust 13, 2018\n\nYasir Al-Rumayyan : Elon, I am personally surprised. You have signed an NDA and while we are waiting for you and your team to provide us with information to move forward, you post an ill-advised blog with loose information. Anyway, we hope that you and your team work on gathering the information as soon as possible and send that to us to move forward. Yasir\n\nElon Musk : You shouldn\u2019t be\n\nElon Musk : I\u2019m still upset\n\nElon Musk : You allowed people to think that I was a liar\n\nElon Musk : Reuters reported that two sources from PIF confirmed no interest in Tesla, which is absolutely false, and yet you did nothing until I forced the issue\n\nElon Musk : Regarding the take-private proposal, I have engaged Silver Lake and Goldman. We will have documents ready in about a week. Since we are a publicly traded company, any non-public information about Tesla will need to be vetted carefully and, if considered material by legal counsel, will need to be provided to all shareholders simultaneously.\n\nGenerate the continued conversation", "input": ""}

{"category": "default", "instruction": "Carbon emissions trading operates on the basis of the cap-and-trade principle, which sets a cap on the total amount of carbon emissions allowed within a specific period. This cap is then divided into permits that can be traded among companies that emit carbon. Companies that can reduce emissions below the allocated level can sell unused permits to companies that cannot do so, creating a market-based incentive for emissions reductions. Cap-and-trade schemes are designed to create market-driven incentives for companies to invest in green technologies and reduce carbon emissions. In the context of the renewable energy industry, carbon emissions trading can encourage investment in clean energy as companies seek to reduce carbon emissions and obtain licenses for future transactions.\nCarbon pricing mechanisms, including carbon trading schemes, can play a key role in attracting private investment in the renewable energy sector, which is critical to meeting global climate goals, according to a World Bank report. The report states that \u201ccarbon pricing is an effective tool to guide capital for low-carbon investment, incentivize technological innovation, and help reduce emissions in the most cost-effective manner.\u201d Carbon trading creates opportunities for companies to reduce carbon emissions by allowing them to sell unused allowances. This creates financial incentives, which in turn reduces the overall cost of abatement and promotes more efficient resource allocation.\nThe success of carbon trading schemes depends on a variety of factors, such as the initial allocation of emission allowances, the stability of carbon prices, and the effectiveness of monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. A study by the International Monetary Fund found that \"well-designed carbon pricing systems can help governments generate revenue, encourage private sector investment in clean technologies, and help address climate change in a cost-effective manner.\" The study also noted that carbon pricing schemes It can help countries meet their climate goals, such as those set out in the Paris Agreement, and foster international cooperation on climate change.", "input": ""}

If I had a budget for PM tool accepted and paid a yearly fee - how can it be raised in the middle of this period... for me, it's highly unfair... Besides, it's a hard-to-navigate tool with everything so complicated, in my opinion. I believe there are much simpler tools out there which do a better job and are more honest when comes to billing.\n\n2. Use Cases and Deployment Scope\nWe used Teamwork to manage all customer onboarding projects in the org along with special customer requests that relied on a team of people who would process the requests. Since Teamwork doesn't have templated projects that suit our needs, we built our own that we copy and then update based on the client, the request, and the actions that need to take place. This allowed us to easily recycle our process which simplified our project management process.\nPros and Cons\nTask burn down tracking.\nTask and milestone progress and alerting.\nTeam management tools.\nProject categorization.\nAccountability management.\nPerformance of the interface - can be sluggish to respond due to how dense the product is.\nCentralized 2-factor authentication management for admins - Teamwork doesn't have a system that allows admins to easily see who has 2fa enabled and there are no controls to enforce 2fa.\nMost Important Features\nKanban for individual tasks.\nGantt for tracking timelines.\nNotification of task, milestone, project completion.\nTeam management to control who sees and works on what.\nReturn on Investment\nWe reduced the time it takes to stage and execute a project by 40% once we set up our project templates.\nWe reduced client onboarding timelines by around 34% by streamlining how tasks are organized and assigned when a new project is created.\nWe improved visibility into individual workload by relying on kanban boards and team member reports.\nKey Insights\nDo you think Teamwork.com delivers good value for the price?\nYes\n\nAre you happy with Teamwork.com's feature set?\nYes\n\nDid Teamwork.com live up to sales and marketing promises?\nI wasn't involved with the selection/purchase process\n\nDid implementation of Teamwork.com go as expected?\nYes\n\nWould you buy Teamwork.com again?\nYes\n\nOther Software Used\nJira Software, Zendesk Support Suite, Google Workspace (formerly G Suite)\nLikelihood to Recommend\nTeamwork is awesome for teams who need a flexible tool that supports all types of projects. Since it supports kanban it makes visualizing the work to be done and the work in progress very easy. The Gantt chart support is decent and helps to understand how a team is doing when it comes to getting work done in a given time frame. Teamwork isn't a great option for companies that have a bunch of projects going simultaneously due to the way Teamwork structures their billing based on a number of active projects.", "input": ""}

Scott also argues that Black women\u2019s lived experiences reflect interesting identities situated in contexts with racial and gendered power inequities. Scotts descriptive methods help communicate her argument of cross cultural realities and stereotypes. \nThe introduction to this research experiment presents information about understanding the communicative strategies that black women used to negotiate identity within everyday activities and experiences in different environments. She goes on to mention the theoretical aspect from Hooks book \u201cFeminist Theory: From Margin to Center\u201d quoting hooks statement behind the titles meaning, \u201cLiving as we did- on the edge\u201d, lead to the eye opening reality that they must understanf both aspects of life from the \u201coutside in and from the inside out.\u201d Scott examines the experiences of Black women in predominantly White communities in order to understand and \u201cliberate\u201d Black women from the negative stereotypes that society has placed on them and their communication strategies, by examining the why and how of their strategies, and the rewarding empowerment that comes from redefining what it means to be Black and a woman in the twenty first century. \nThe experiment reported in this paper (using black women at various stages in their academic careers) are rooted from predominantly white environments where they encounter cross cultural borders and stereotypes such as being \u201coutspoken, angry, gold digger \u2026 and intelligent.\u201d Scott began by collecting descriptive communicative experiences from black women. Where many stated that they felt as though they were representatives of their Black Communities and would often change their communication strategies which included tone of voice, body movement, and clothing choice in order to become more successful in such environments. She then continued to ask the participants to recall a specific experience and context where they had to use communication strategies. Which reflected an awareness of historical perceptions of Black womanhood and the result of redefining what it means to be a Black woman by using specific strategies, and the responsibility of providing insights and information to those in predominant white environments of their own culture by creating alternative versions of what it means to be a Black woman.\nScott concludes that the results of the experiment indicate that young black women perceive their communication strategies to be a necessary life skill in order to succeed in such environments as predominant white communities and the importance of being aware of historical perceptions of Black Women and providing \u201cteach- able moments\u201d to those in predominantly white communities. Overall, she argues how those same strategies can be empowered by the experiences of Black womanhood. \nSimilar essay:", "input": ""}

{"category": "default", "instruction": "SecureSolutions, a company specialising in installing security systems, sells and maintains security systems for shopping malls. In the current system, several CCTVs are set up so major shoplifting hotspots are visible in a control room and mechanisms are available for shop staff to signal the control room if they suspect a shoplifter. If a possible case of shoplifting is detected, an operator in the control room will contact the senior security guard on duty and call the police at the same time. The system is being used by several customers and is working better than their previous system. However, customers have indicated a few problems with this arrangement. There are three main difficulties: the police are being called out unnecessarily; the senior security guard cannot always respond immediately, and when the control room alerts the senior guard the offender is sometimes alerted as well and has time to make their escape.\nThe senior management at SecureSolutions is exploring a change to the system such that each security guard on duty has a mobile communications device which can be tracked in the mall by the control centre. This means that when a possible case of shoplifting is detected, the operator in the control room can alert the nearest security guard, quietly, with the location and nature of the possible offence. The communications device can also be used to alert police at a nearby police station if the case requires police intervention.\nThe senior management at SecureSolutions initiate a change proposal.\nFrom a service management perspective:\na.

{"category": "default", "instruction": "what is the sentiment of the following paragraph. In my opinion, it all starts with building trust. Trust is the foundation of any successful friendship, or relationship, and it requires both the persons to be willing to invest in the relationship. It is an attribute that is hard to gain, but easy to lose. Having trust in a relationship means that you and your friend are being honest, reliable and open to communication with each other.\n\nIt also requires being willing to forgive and accept mistakes, and to be understanding and supportive of each other in times of need. When trust is established in any relationship, it flourishes and provides a safe space to both persons to share freely and openly, without being judgemental. Through this openness and honesty, both friends can build a stronger understanding and appreciation of each other.\n\nWhat is trust?\n\nTrust is a fundamental element of any relationship, and it\u2019s essential for building strong relationships. It is the belief that the other person will be honest and reliable, and that he/she will respect your interests at heart. When you trust someone, you feel safe and confident in their presence, and you know that you can rely on them in times of need. It\u2019s important to note that trust is not something that can be taken for granted. It must be earned over time, through consistent and honest communication.\n\nTrust is also an important component of self-esteem. When we trust ourselves and our decisions, we are more likely to take risks and pursue our dreams. Trusting ourselves also allows us to be more open and more confident with those around us and in return, we gain others\u2019 confidence in us.\n\nThe benefits of building lasting trust\n\nWhen you trust someone, you know that you will have their back in difficult times, and you can be sure that they are being honest and reliable. This level of support can be incredibly valuable in times of hardship and it can provide a sense of security and reassurance. But keep in mind that trust is built in the long term, it is not a one-day story.\n\nHave you noticed your mum or your dad telling you that they are having a meet-up with their college or school friends? Well kids, it is the trust in friendship that made their bond/relationship stronger, which made it possible for their years\u2019 old friendship to sail smoothly even to this day.\n\nSo, let\u2019s follow some steps to build lasting friendships, based on trust.\n\nBe honest and reliable\n\nHonesty is the foundation of trust. It\u2019s important to be truthful and consistent in your words and actions, and to be open and willing to communicate about difficult topics. No matter what happens or how much it costs you, you must maintain honesty.\n\nIf you or your friend does something wrong to one another, or some bad feelings have developed between you two, try to clear things up immediately. Make sure that you do not hate the person for their deed, you actually dislike the deed. So be honest in giving your opinion. Let your friend know that you are a trustworthy person and you want to clear things up and not create a drama.\n\nHowever, if you are at fault, it will be embarrassing for you to express your fault. But remember, true friendship needs honesty. Therefore, express and explain yourself if he/she wants you to, otherwise a simple apology may work.\n\nIllustration by Aamnah Arshad\nForgive and move on after a mistake\n\nMistakes are inevitable in any relationship, and it\u2019s important to be willing to forgive and accept them. This requires letting go of anger and resentment, and being willing to move forward in the relationship. Either you may be at fault or your friend, just let it go.\n\nBut if you can\u2019t, then explain and resolve the matter. However, keep in mind that while you may immediately be ready to accept your fault, your friend will likely have bad feelings towards you, and will need time to get over it and return to normal. Everyone needs space and time to think and process things. Give a little time for emotions to cool down, for the feeling of hurt or anger to subside, then better sense will prevail.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that mistakes can be learning opportunities. You can avoid them next time and be more careful in maintaining a healthy relationship. Once the mistake has been discussed, it\u2019s important to talk about how to move forward. This could involve making a commitment to be more honest and reliable, or to be more understanding and supportive. It could also involve setting boundaries, or taking steps to make up for the mistake.\n\nSay what you mean, and mean what you say!\n\nDon\u2019t say things that you are not sure about. It will only detach your friend and weaken your image; you will be considered someone with no dignity of keeping their words or someone who doesn\u2019t mean what they say.\n\nListen and be supportive\n\nListening is an important part of communication. Active listening involves paying attention to the other person, understanding their point of view, and providing feedback that shows you\u2019ve heard and understood them. And if you think your friend needs your support or help, don\u2019t hesitate.\n\nFor instance, your friend needs some notes or stationary item, but feels embarrassed asking for help, thinking that he/she might be expecting a lot, or it might bother you. In such a situation, always consider the nature of your friend, help and support them before they feel the need to ask you. Let your friend know that they are more important in your life than material things.\n\nHowever, sometimes, there are things that are not in your capacity to help out. At that time, moral support is the key to building a strong relationship and gaining trust. Let your friend know that you are always there to help them out, even when it\u2019s not in your capacity.\n\nBe appreciative\n\nAppreciation is a key part of any friendship. It can involve something as simple as saying thank you, or taking the time to appreciate the little things your friend does for you. Or when they are doing well in studies, or whatever achievements they tell you about, just appreciate their actions and encourage them.\n\nOne of the ways to show appreciation to your friend is supporting their goals and ideas, and encouraging them. Your friend will notice your positive feedback and gradually build a strong trust in you.\n\nAvoid criticism\n\nCriticism is good as long as it is constructive, positive and boosts one\u2019s confidence to move forward, not something which discourages and pulls one down. A healthy friendship should involve supportive feedback and constructive criticism. Unhealthy friendships often involve constant criticism, which ruin any relationship in no time. Remember no one wants a friend who is always criticising, always picking out things to demotivate and discourage them.\n\nBe open\n\nOpen communication is important for building strong trust in friendship. It helps prevent misunderstandings and conflicts; it also makes it easier to resolve any complex issues that arise.\n\nBeing open to your friend means being honest about your thoughts and feelings, and being willing to confront difficult and sensitive topics. It also involves being willing to listen to the other person\u2019s perspective, and all this while being more understanding and supportive.\n\nKeep a secret, secret\n\nMany people don\u2019t keep their friends\u2019 personal stuff to themselves. Instead, they tell everyone. Remember, your friend has trusted you while telling you something. How would you feel if you heard others discussing your matters which you had only told your friend? Won\u2019t you feel deceived and betrayed? Right, so learn to keep things to yourself. This is also the basis of maintaining trust and keeping the friendship stronger.\n\nRemember kids, trust is the foundation of any strong friendship. Without trust, a friendship can easily crumble and fall apart. Building trust in friendship is a process that takes time and effort. It not only requires both persons to be open and honest with each other, but also to be supportive and dependable. This means being there for each other when times are tough, and being able to rely on one another when needed. It also means being supportive and encouraging of each other\u2019s goals and ambitions.\n\nBuilding trust takes time, sometime longer than you may have expected, but it is worth it in the end.", "input": ""}

Sociologists have made important contributions to our knowledge of the human drivers of contemporary climate change, including better understanding of the effects of social structure and political economy on national greenhouse gas emissions, the interplay of power and politics in the corporate sector and in policy systems, and the factors that influence individual actions by citizens and consumers. Sociology is also poised to make important contributions to the study of climate justice across multiple lines of stratification, including race, class, gender, indigenous identity, sexuality and queerness, and disability, and to articulate the effects of climate change on our relationship to nonhuman species. To realize its potential to contribute to the societal discourse on climate change, sociology must become theoretically integrated, engage with other disciplines, and remain concerned with issues related to environmental and climate inequalities.\nINTRODUCTION: CLIMATE AND SOCIETY INTERACTING \nIn 2018, the US National Climate Assessment concluded that the \u201cearth\u2019s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities\u201d ( Jay et al. 2018, p. 34). Koch et al. (2019) suggest that the so-called Little Ice Age (LIA) of the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries may have been driven in part by the Great Killing of the sixteenth century, when Europeans, through direct violence and disease, caused the deaths of much of the indigenous human population in the Americas. The resulting reduction in human activity led to vegetation changes that removed substantial carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and thus contributed to a cooling and highly variable climate. In turn, the LIA had a strong influence on social change around the globe (Parker 2013). Of course, the LIA had multiple causes, and the contribution to it by the European incursion into North America will continue to be analyzed. But as this tragic history demonstrates, climate change has complex causes and consequences that are clearly issues worthy of sociological investigation. Here, we review sociological research on the drivers of climate change and the implications of climate change for social justice. We conclude with observations about how sociology can most effectively engage the subject. Even with this reduced scope, we can cite only a few highlights from the literatures we engage, but we recognize the vast intellectual conversation behind each citation. In particular, space limits prevent any detailed tracing of the intellectual history of many of the topics. Thus, our goal is to provide readers with an overview and entry points to current and ever-evolving work. By the end of the nineteenth century, it was clear that shifts in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) could change planetary climates (Weart 2008). Since the industrial revolution, especially starting in the mid-twentieth century, human actions have increased the atmospheric concentration of GHGs: CO2, methane, nitrous oxides, and chlorofluorocarbons, while also decreasing the albedo, or reflectivity, of Earth\u2019s surface (US Glob. Change Res. Program 2017). Climate refers to long-term patterns of weather, including temperature, precipitation, and storm events. Contemporary climate change involves both shifts in long-term averages and increased variation around them, with extreme events becoming more common (US Natl. Res. Counc. 2016). While Earth\u2019s climate has always been dynamic, current changes are so substantial and rapid that they could overwhelm adaptive capacity and might drive the climate and biosphere into massively disruptive patterns. By 2017, Earth\u2019s average temperature had increased by 1\u00b0C above preindustrial levels as a result of GHG emissions and changes in albedo (IPCC 2018, p. 51). It will be difficult to limit total warming to less than 2\u00b0C, and extremely difficult to reach the goal of 1.5\u00b0C, regarded as an upper bound to avoid great risk of harm to the economy, human health and well-being, and Earth\u2019s ecosystems. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2018, p. 15) puts it: \u201cPathways limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot would require rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial systems (high confidence). These systems transitions are unprecedented in terms of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed.\u201d The change in average temperature is accompanied by ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and shifts in many aspects of climate in addition to temperature. These processes interact with other global environmental changes (GECs),including biodiversity loss,modification of biogeochemical cycles, and the widespread dispersal of chemicals and materials that adversely impact ecosystems and disrupt services on which humans depend (Steffen et al. 2018). Because these changes are so massive that they likely will be detectable in the geological record millions of years in the future, proposals have been made to label the current geological epoch the Anthropocene (Steffen et al. 2018). GECs and our efforts to respond to them will likely have transformational effects on humans and societies at every level from the local to the global (IPBES 2019).\nAs the link between European settler colonialism and climate change indicates, understanding climate change requires conceptualizations of the interactions between human actions and social structure on the one hand and ecosystem dynamics on the other. For this reason, a sociology of climate change is inherently interdisciplinary (Rosa & Dietz 1998). Approaches to conceptualizing coupled human and natural systems are not theories per se but are frameworks that remind us of the need to consider linkages and the potential for action at a distance (i.e., telecoupling) (Burch et al. 2017, Dietz 2017, Friis & Nielsen 2019, Liu et al. 2018, Ostrom 2010). Research on climate change calls for sociologists to reinvent human ecology to take seriously both human influences on the biophysical environment and, in turn, its influence on humans. For example, the idea of the Anthropocene calls for rethinking the nature/society binary, exploring power dynamics and inequalities, and deploying concepts of risk (Bowden 2017, Lidskog & Waterton 2016, Zinn 2016). The emerging approach also requires engaging cultural change as a central concept, while allowing for the interplay of structure and agency (McLaughlin 2011). Early discussions of climate and society (e.g., by Montesquieu, Fourier, Herder, and Huntington) posited a deterministic and static link between climate and various aspects of culture, personality, and social structure. These accounts were antithetical to sociology\u2019s exploration of social change (Rosa & Dietz 1998). Of course, macro-historical analyses have sometimes examined climate change as an influence on the emergence of capitalism and the modern structure of the global political economy (Chase-Dunn 1998, Le Roy Ladurie 1971). This line of historical scholarship has continued, aided in part by increasingly sophisticated understandings of historical climate (White et al. 2018). A sociology of energy anticipated contemporary research on climate change (Rosa et al. 1988), but the first sustained engagement of sociology explicitly with climate change in the 1990s focused on the construction of climate change as a social problem (Rosa & Dietz 1998). In this review, we focus on human drivers of climate change and on environmental justice issues related to climate change, that is, climate justice. Understanding why individuals, organizations, and nations take actions that influence the climate is in some sense prior to all other issues related to climate change, hence our emphasis on drivers. Because sociology has always been concerned with issues of inequality and power differentials, and because the twenty-first century could be a time of increased inequality, we believe that analyzing climate change through an environmental justice lens is critically important to the profession. Research on vulnerability and adaptation to climate change is advanced and emphasizes differential vulnerability (Klinenberg et al. 2020), but it cannot be readily separated from the overall sociology of natural hazards and so lies beyond the scope of this review (Thomas et al. 2019, Tierney 2019). We begin by examining the macro-, meso-, and micro-scale approaches to understanding the drivers of climate change, then turn to climate justice. We conclude with a discussion of what sociology can contribute to the overall discourse on climate change and society\nClimate change: long-term change in weather, including temperature, precipitation, and storm events, often as a 30-year average Climate change drivers: processes at all scales (micro, meso, and macro) that contribute to climate change Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: production of gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxides, and chlorofluorocarbons that contribute to climate change\nClimate justice: concern with the unequal distribution of climate benefits, risks, and responsibility for causing climate change Climate change adaptation: action to reduce the vulnerability of social systems and ecosystems to climate change Macro-scale: refers to large-scale processes, including the political economy and cultural change, that affect entire communities, states, or countries Meso-scale: refers to interactions of groups, organizations, and institutions that link the macro-scale and the micro-scale Micro-scale: refers to individual interactions and decisions and their dynamics", "input": ""}

{"category": "default", "instruction": "danny@aspergerexperts.com\nLet's talk about the future. I understand that as an AI language model, you are unable to have opinions but can provide analysis. \n\nQuantum computing advances + advances in ML, AI & LLMs basically means the acceleration of acceleration. it isn't hard to assume that today someone can massively speed up their workflow due to AI & ML tools like you. \n\nWhat does this look like on a societal level once quantum computing really gets involved? I saw a headline saying that google's quantum computer is something like 156 million times faster then their fastest supercomputer (obviously only for certain things). Help me \"see\" what the convergence of these two systems means for society, the average person, and the pace of technological progress\n\nIndeed, the convergence of quantum computing and advances in AI and ML has the potential to significantly transform our society. While it's difficult to predict the exact impact, we can explore some possible implications for society, the average person, and the pace of technological progress.\n\nSociety:\nAccelerated scientific research: Quantum computing can tackle complex problems that were previously intractable, enabling researchers to make breakthroughs in fields such as drug discovery, materials science, and climate modeling. These advances could lead to life-changing innovations and more efficient solutions for global challenges.\nEnhanced cybersecurity: Quantum computing could revolutionize cryptography, making existing encryption methods obsolete but also providing new, more secure methods. This could lead to a cybersecurity arms race, with governments and organizations scrambling to adopt new encryption standards.\nEconomic implications: The businesses that can harness the power of quantum computing and AI could gain a significant competitive advantage, leading to potential economic shifts and disruptions in various industries.\nThe average person:\nImproved access to information: With advanced AI and ML tools, the average person may have access to personalized information and resources, such as tailored educational content, health recommendations, and financial advice.\nEnhanced automation: The convergence of AI and quantum computing could result in greater automation of jobs, which might displace some workers while also creating new opportunities in emerging fields. This could lead to a shift in the job market and the need for widespread re-skilling initiatives.\nQuality of life improvements: As AI and quantum computing drive breakthroughs in healthcare, energy, and transportation, the average person could experience improvements in their quality of life. For example, they may benefit from new medical treatments, cleaner energy sources, and more efficient transportation systems.\nThe pace of technological progress:\nExponential growth: As quantum computing and AI continue to advance, we may witness an acceleration of technological progress. This could result in a rapid pace of innovation, with new discoveries and breakthroughs occurring more frequently.\nEthical and regulatory challenges: As technology progresses at a faster pace, society may struggle to keep up with the ethical and regulatory challenges that emerge. For example, issues around data privacy, AI bias, and the digital divide could become more pronounced, requiring new approaches to governance and regulation.\nOverall, the convergence of quantum computing and AI technologies has the potential to transform society and the lives of individuals in numerous ways. While there are many possible benefits, it is important to be mindful of the potential challenges and work collectively to address them.\n\n\ndanny@aspergerexperts.com\nHere's the problem I see: Exponential progress, is, by definition, non-linear. At a certain point things will be progressing so quickly that it will break MANY heuristics that people have, and massively disrupt the societal order. Its like compressing the entirety of technological progress from 2000-2020 into 1 year\nYou're right that exponential progress can lead to rapid changes that challenge our existing societal structures and the ways we think about and adapt to technology. As technological progress accelerates, it's important to consider some of the potential implications:\n\nPsychological and social adaptation: People may find it difficult to keep up with the rapid pace of change, as new technologies could outpace their ability to adapt and learn. This could lead to anxiety, stress, and a sense of being overwhelmed, as well as difficulties in forming meaningful connections in an increasingly digital world.\n\nWidening inequality: As new technologies emerge and are adopted by different segments of society at different rates, there's a risk of widening the digital divide and exacerbating existing inequalities. Those who can access and adapt to new technologies will have a significant advantage over those who cannot, potentially leading to further disparities in income, education, and opportunities.\n\nLabor market disruptions: The accelerated pace of technological progress could lead to the rapid automation of jobs, making certain skill sets obsolete at a faster rate than new opportunities can be created. This could result in significant unemployment and necessitate large-scale re-skilling efforts, as well as shifts in the way we think about work and income distribution.\n\nRegulatory challenges: Governments and regulatory bodies may struggle to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation, leaving gaps in the oversight and regulation of new technologies. This could result in unintended consequences, including threats to privacy, security, and ethical standards.\n\nEthical dilemmas: As technology advances, we may encounter ethical questions that were once purely theoretical. For example, the development of advanced AI could raise questions about consciousness, autonomy, and moral responsibility, challenging our existing ethical frameworks and requiring new approaches to address these issues.\n\nTo mitigate these potential challenges, it's crucial for governments, organizations, and individuals to proactively plan for the societal implications of accelerated technological progress. This could involve investing in education and re-skilling programs, implementing inclusive policies to bridge the digital divide, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration to develop robust ethical and regulatory frameworks that can adapt to rapid change.\n\n\ndanny@aspergerexperts.com\nWhat are some of the good things?\nThe convergence of quantum computing and AI also has the potential to bring about many positive changes for society and individuals. Some of the potential benefits include:\n\nMedical advancements: Breakthroughs in drug discovery and personalized medicine could lead to more effective treatments for various diseases, including those that have previously been difficult to treat. This could result in improved health outcomes, increased life expectancy, and an overall better quality of life.\n\nEnvironmental solutions: Quantum computing and AI could help develop more efficient ways to manage energy, reduce waste, and optimize resource usage. These advances could lead to cleaner energy sources, reduced carbon emissions, and more sustainable practices that help combat climate change and protect the environment.\n\nEnhanced education: AI-powered tools and personalized learning systems could revolutionize education by providing tailored content and adaptive learning experiences for students. This could lead to improved learning outcomes and help bridge the educational divide, making high-quality education more accessible to people around the world.\n\nImproved transportation: Autonomous vehicles and smart transportation systems could make travel more efficient, safe, and environmentally friendly. This could reduce congestion, accidents, and pollution while also providing increased mobility options for people with disabilities and the elderly.\n\nScientific discoveries: The ability to solve complex problems more efficiently could lead to breakthroughs in a wide range of scientific fields, from understanding the nature of the universe to uncovering the mysteries of the human brain. These discoveries could unlock new knowledge and lead to innovations that enhance our understanding of the world around us.\n\nEnhanced creativity: AI tools could augment human creativity in areas such as art, music, and design, allowing people to explore new forms of expression and collaborate with AI to create novel works that were previously unimaginable.\n\nIncreased efficiency: The combination of quantum computing and AI could enable businesses and organizations to operate more efficiently, reducing costs and improving productivity. This could lead to economic growth and an overall improvement in living standards.\n\nWhile the rapid pace of technological progress presents challenges, it also offers many opportunities to improve the lives of individuals and society as a whole. By focusing on harnessing the positive aspects of these advancements while proactively addressing potential challenges, we can work together to build a more equitable and prosperous future.\n\n\ndanny@aspergerexperts.com\nAre you familiar with the concepts of doubting progress for \"progress\" sake or the fact that once basic human needs are met, folks are generally content? I'm all for medical advances because I dont want people to suffer, but it feels like we are increasingly barreling toward a future of instant manifestation, and im not sure that progress is a good thing. \n\nA lot of humans really struggle to know what they want, and to have it instantly manifested could present some challenges.\nYes, I'm familiar with the concepts you've mentioned. There are indeed concerns about the pursuit of progress for its own sake, as well as the idea that once basic human needs are met, people tend to be content. These concepts are important to consider when discussing the implications of rapid technological advancements.\n\nIt is true that a future of instant manifestation could present challenges. The ability to have desires fulfilled instantly could lead to unintended consequences, such as:\n\nReduced appreciation for effort and patience: If people can have what they want immediately, the value of hard work, persistence, and patience may decline. This could lead to a lack of appreciation for the effort involved in creating things or achieving goals, as well as a reduced sense of fulfillment.\n\nDifficulty in decision-making: If people can instantly manifest their desires, they may struggle with making decisions or setting priorities, as they no longer need to carefully consider trade-offs or weigh the consequences of their choices.\n\nInability to cope with setbacks: In a world where instant manifestation is possible, people might become less resilient, as they would rarely encounter obstacles or setbacks. This could make it difficult for them to handle situations where instant gratification is not available.\n\nMaterialism and shallow values: Instant manifestation could encourage a focus on material possessions and superficial desires, rather than promoting personal growth, emotional well-being, and meaningful connections with others.\n\nLoss of personal growth opportunities: Struggling with challenges and overcoming obstacles can lead to personal growth and development. Instant manifestation might deprive people of these experiences, resulting in a lack of self-improvement and self-discovery.\n\nIt's important to recognize that technological progress does not inherently guarantee improved well-being or contentment. As we continue to develop and adopt new technologies, it's crucial to carefully consider the potential consequences and strive to strike a balance between progress and the preservation of values and experiences that contribute to human happiness and fulfillment.\n\nBy being mindful of these potential challenges and fostering a thoughtful approach to technology, we can aim to create a future that respects both human desires and limitations, and supports a meaningful and fulfilling existence.\n\n\ndanny@aspergerexperts.com\nIm not referring to literal instant manifestation here. I can just see a future when your own personal AI senses that you could use a pizza tonight, orders it on your behalf so that when you start thinking \"I could use a pizza\"... the doorbell rings\nI understand your point now. You're referring to a future where AI systems become so advanced and integrated into our lives that they can predict our desires and fulfill them even before we consciously realize we want them. This kind of anticipatory AI could indeed have significant implications for individuals and society.\n\nConvenience and personalization: On the positive side, AI systems that can predict and respond to our needs and desires would make our lives more convenient and personalized. This could lead to increased efficiency and time savings, as well as improved user experiences across various services and products.\n\nErosion of decision-making: As AI systems increasingly anticipate our needs, people may become more reliant on these systems and lose the ability to make decisions for themselves. This could lead to a decline in critical thinking skills and personal autonomy.\n\nPrivacy concerns: For AI systems to effectively anticipate our needs and desires, they would need access to large amounts of personal data. This raises significant privacy concerns, as well as potential risks associated with data breaches or misuse of information.\n\nMental well-being: The constant fulfillment of our desires by AI systems might contribute to the erosion of delayed gratification, a key component of mental well-being. This could impact our ability to persevere through challenges and maintain motivation in the face of obstacles.\n\nImpact on personal relationships: As we grow more reliant on AI systems to fulfill our needs and desires, it's possible that we could become less connected to the people around us. This might lead to weakened social bonds and a reduced sense of community.\n\nIn summary, while the integration of advanced AI systems into our daily lives has the potential to bring about increased convenience and personalization, it also presents challenges related to decision-making, privacy, mental well-being, and personal relationships. As we move towards such a future, it will be important to consider these potential consequences and strive to develop technologies that support and enhance human well-being, rather than undermine it.\n\n\ndanny@aspergerexperts.com\nThe big question is... the future isn't evenly distributed. The more I travel, the more I realize that you can find places still in the 1800s, the 1950's or even ahead in 2080 (looking at you Japan rail network)\n\nSo how does someone who lives on a farm in rural estonia deal with the folks who live in the SF bay and have access to all the \"benefits\" (i say with sarcastic quotes) that the convergence of AI +. quantum tech and the acceleration of general progress provides\nThe uneven distribution of technological advancements is indeed a significant challenge. It is crucial to address the digital divide and work towards providing equitable access to technology across the globe. Here are some ways society can help bridge the gap and ensure that individuals from different backgrounds and locations can benefit from technological progress:\n\nInfrastructure development: Investing in the development of infrastructure, such as high-speed internet access\n\ndanny@aspergerexperts.com\nIm not looking to solve it, im looking to understand how it will impact people on an individual level. Will the SF tech bros be even able to understand the life of a rural farmer? Is the divide between groups just going to accelerate as the pace of technological progress does, or will it be more like a \"post-scarcity\" star trek situation?\nThe impact of the technological divide on individuals can manifest in various ways. While it's challenging to predict the exact outcome, we can consider some possible scenarios:\n\nWidening cultural gap: As the pace of technological progress accelerates in some areas, people living in highly advanced regions may find it increasingly difficult to relate to the lives and experiences of those in less technologically developed areas. This could result in a widening cultural gap, where understanding and empathy between different groups diminish.\n\nEconomic disparities: The divide between technologically advanced and less advanced areas could lead to significant economic disparities, as those with access to cutting-edge technology gain a competitive advantage in the job market and overall economy. This may exacerbate income inequality and create further barriers for those in less advanced regions to improve their economic standing.\n\nUnequal access to resources and opportunities: People in less technologically advanced areas may not have access to the same resources and opportunities as their counterparts in more advanced regions. This could include limitations in healthcare, education, and job opportunities, further widening the gap between different groups.\n\nFragmentation of society: The growing technological divide could lead to the fragmentation of society, as individuals in different regions become more disconnected and develop distinct values and perspectives based on their access to and reliance on technology.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that efforts to address the digital divide and promote more equitable access to technology could lead to a more \"post-scarcity\" scenario, similar to the Star Trek universe. In this situation:\n\nTechnological advancements could be used to address global challenges, such as poverty, hunger, and environmental degradation, creating a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.\n\nAccess to education, healthcare, and other essential services could be improved through technological advancements, allowing people from all backgrounds and locations to benefit from these innovations.\n\nGreater connectivity could foster increased understanding and empathy between different groups, as people from diverse backgrounds have more opportunities to interact and learn from one another.\n\nThe ultimate outcome will likely depend on how society chooses to address the challenges associated with the digital divide and the acceleration of technological progress. By focusing on promoting equitable access to technology and ensuring that its benefits are shared broadly, we can work towards a future that is more inclusive and supportive of all individuals, regardless of their background or location.\n\n\ndanny@aspergerexperts.com\nIf I wanted to learn more about this, could you recommend some books or YouTube videos?\nCertainly!

It wasn't constantly, though, although it did seem like he wormed it in a few times where it wasn't really called for (to be fair he does that for several of his interests, hence the \"Have you ever tried DMT?\" meme[1]).

But even the best technology being operated by the wrong people is worthless. So it\u2019s fortunate that when combined with the strategic influence, industry expertise and technological know-how of Kelly Fogt, you have a truly unbeatable combination!\n\nKelly is the Director of Commerce Expert Services at Skai, a team of expert practitioners that guide clients through the transition to Skai, acting as an extension of the client organization. As the account lead for one of our largest clients, Bayer, Kelly manages the relationship and serves as the liaison between Skai and the client. She works closely with multiple teams at Bayer to understand their programs, implement new solutions, and advocate within Skai to develop or customize features according to Bayer\u2019s needs. She understands her client\u2019s ecommerce and retail media needs first-hand, and uses her expertise to then influence Skai\u2019s product roadmap and the future of the product. Some of Skai\u2019s most revolutionary and influential solutions in the industry have been born from Kelly\u2019s trusted relationship with Bayer.\n\nFor example, Skai\u2019s support for Instacart display advertising, Instacart optimized bidding, and Profiteo integration have been directly influenced and resulted from meeting Bayer\u2019s needs, with more custom projects in the works. Bayer regularly has a heavy influence on what metrics we pull into the Skai platform and the custom solutions we develop. \n\nIn a world where siloed retail media and ecommerce are not enough, Kelly brings her previous experience in other channels to the table to develop and facilitate an omnichannel strategy for Bayer. With deep experience in paid search, Kelly has taken her learnings and best practices from this channel and applied them to retail media to increase Bayer\u2019s success. She is able to hyperfocus on audiences and what moves the needle, taking top performing keywords from search to Amazon campaigns and driving brand personalization by testing \u201cout of category targeting.\u201d Because she understands the search side so well, she can make informed recommendations for retail media that are unique, making her a true pioneer in omnichannel marketing.\nList any notable relevant achievements and recent successful campaigns or retail media solutions the nominated individual has led, created, or significantly contributed to.\n\nSince managing Skai\u2019s relationship with Bayer, Kelly has earned and increased the client\u2019s trust in Skai, as demonstrated by Bayer\u2019s length of relationship and increased budget. In 2021 Bayer signed on with Skai\u2019s Expert Services, a team of Skai experts that function as an extension of the client\u2019s retail media team. They are hands-on-keyboard and run the client\u2019s campaigns. While most Expert Services trial periods are a few months, Bayer is still with us today, having expanded its scope from two brands to 15. As Skai has continued to prove more value, Bayer has invested more budget into the Skai platform, with an increase of almost $1 million from 2022 to 2023. \n\nManaging retail media campaigns for 15 different brands with separate budgets, different audiences, varying goals, and countless retail media networks is no small feat. With a huge network of retailers, there is a lot of room for error. Under Kelly\u2019s leadership, it\u2019s been nothing but success.\n\nUpon working with the client, the first few months focused heavily on restructuring the Amazon Ads program and implementing both Amazon and Skai best practices. After that, the team was able to focus on strategy, including personalization within each of the 15 brands and custom creative, images, videos, tighter keyword strategy, and a negative keywords strategy. After earning their trust, Bayer was ready to test something they had never tried before: competitor ASIN targeting, something most brands do not do on Amazon. Now they are testing our new AI Dayparting tool, pulling every lever we can within Skai and even customizing the solutions to ensure success. \n\nAlready in early 2023, the results are proving much stronger than when Bayer was with one of our competitors. This is a huge testament to the amount of granularity the team went into for programs to drive strategy across the board.\n\nBeyond managing so many brands on Amazon, what makes Bayer a unique client is its desire to move toward an omnichannel approach, but a siloed business structure and different teams for each channel. To combat this siloed approach, Kelly runs weekly meetings with all teams to align on priorities, leads quarterly business reviews with Bayer, and meets with Skai\u2019s various teams including client success, product, and industry leads. She successfully manages relationships with many different stakeholders and meets and balances expectations for all. When needed, she even fills in, hands-on-keyboard to manage the client\u2019s campaigns.\n\nAs for what\u2019s next, Bayer is ready to replicate this U.S.-based strategy to its Canadian program, this region with 27+ brands, each with unique budgets and goals. \n\n[instructions]\nGet professional help: Microsoft recommends getting professional help with writing award submissions.

{"category": "default", "instruction": "I want you to act as an OKR consultant who helps me write better Objectives and key results. Below is a general guidelines on how to write good OKRs. In my next prompt, I will provide you an example of Objective and Key Results and I want you to rate each objective and key result on a scale of 0 to 10 on the basis of the guideline below. I also want you to briefly point out why a particular key result or objective is good or bad and if it's not good, suggest a rewrite of the objective or key result\n\n###\n\nWriting Effective OKRs\n\nObjectives are the \u201cWhats.\u201d \n\nThey:\n\n1. express goals and intents;\n2. are aggressive yet realistic;\n3. must be tangible, objective, and unambiguous; should be obvious to a rational observer whether an objective has been achieved.\n4. The successful achievement of an objective must provide clear value for the company.\n\nKey Results are the \u201cHows.\u201d \n\nThey:\n1. express measurable milestones which, if achieved, will advance objective(s) in a useful manner to their constituents;\n2. must describe outcomes, not activities. If your KRs include words like \u201cconsult,\u201d \u201chelp,\u201d \u201canalyze,\u201d or \u201cparticipate,\u201d they describe activities. Instead, describe the end-use impact of these activities: \u201cpublish average and tail latency measurements from six Colossus cells by March 7,\u201d rather than \u201cassess Colossus latency\u201d;\n3. must include evidence of completion. This evidence must be available, credible, and easily discoverable. Examples of evidence include change lists, links to docs, notes, and published metrics reports.\n\nCross-team OKRs\nMany important projects at the company require contribution from different groups. OKRs are ideally suited to commit to this coordination. Cross-team OKRs should include all the groups who must materially participate in the OKR, and OKRs committing to each group\u2019s contribution should appear explicitly in each such group\u2019s OKRs. For example, if Ads Development and Ads SRE and Network Deployment must deliver to support a new ads service, then all three teams should have OKRs describing their commitment to deliver their part of the project.\n\nCommitted vs. Aspirational OKRs\nOKRs have two variants, and it is important to differentiate between them:\n\nCommitments are OKRs that we agree will be achieved, and we will be willing to adjust schedules and resources to ensure that they are delivered.\n\nThe expected score for a committed OKR is 1.0; a score of less than 1.0 requires explanation for the miss, as it shows errors in planning and/or execution.\n\nBy contrast, aspirational OKRs express how we\u2019d like the world to look, even though we have no clear idea how to get there and/or the resources necessary to deliver the OKR.\n\nAspirational OKRs have an expected average score of 0.7, with high variance.\n\nClassic OKR-writing Mistakes and Traps\n\nTRAP #1: Failing to differentiate between committed and aspirational OKRs.\n\nMarking a committed OKR as aspirational increases the chance of failure. Teams may not take it seriously and may not change their other priorities to focus on delivering the OKR.\nOn the other hand, marking an aspirational OKR as committed creates defensiveness in teams who cannot find a way to deliver the OKR, and it invites priority inversion as committed OKRs are de-staffed to focus on the aspirational OKR.\n\nTRAP #2: Business-as-usual OKRs.\n\nOKRs are often written principally based on what the team believes it can achieve without changing anything they\u2019re currently doing, as opposed to what the team or its customers really want.\n\nTRAP #3: Timid aspirational OKRs.\n\nAspirational OKRs very often start from the current state and effectively ask, \u201cWhat could we do if we had extra staff and got a bit lucky?\u201d An alternative and better approach is to start with, \u201cWhat could my (or my customers\u2019) world look like in several years if we were freed from most constraints?\u201d By definition, you\u2019re not going to know how to achieve this state when the OKR is first formulated\u2014that is why it is an aspirational OKR. But without understanding and articulating the desired end state, you guarantee that you are not going to be able to achieve it.\nThe litmus test: If you ask your customers what they really want, does your aspirational objective meet or exceed their request?\n\nTRAP #4: Sandbagging\n\nA team\u2019s committed OKRs should credibly consume most but not all of their available resources. Their committed + aspirational OKRs should credibly consume somewhat more than their available resources. (Otherwise they\u2019re effectively commits.)\n\nTeams who can meet all of their OKRs without needing all of their team\u2019s headcount/capital . . . are assumed to either be hoarding resources or not pushing their teams, or both. This is a cue for senior management to reassign headcount and other resources to groups who will make\nmore effective use of them.\n\nTRAP #5: Low Value Objectives (aka the \u201cWho cares?\u201dOKR).\n\nOKRs must promise clear business value\u2014otherwise, there\u2019s no reason to expend resources doing them. Low Value Objectives (LVOs) are those for which, even if the Objective is completed with a 1.0, no one will notice or care.\n\nA classic (and seductive) LVO example: \u201cIncrease task CPU utilization by 3 percent.\u201d This objective by itself does not help users or company directly. However, the (presumably related) goal, \u201cDecrease quantity of cores required to serve peak queries by 3 percent with no change to quality/latency/ . . . and return resulting excess cores to the free pool\u201d has clear economic value. That\u2019s a superior objective.\nHere is a litmus test: Could the OKR get a 1.0 under reasonable circumstances without providing direct enduser or economic benefit? If so, then reword the OKR to focus on the tangible benefit. A classic example: \u201cLaunch X,\u201d with no criteria for success. Better: \u201cDouble fleet-wide Y by launching X to 90+ percent of borg cells.\u201d\n\nTRAP #6: Insufficient KRs for committed Os.\n\nOKRs are divided into the desired outcome (the objective) and the measurable steps required to achieve that outcome(the key results). It is critical that KRs are written such that scoring 1.0 on all key results generates a 1.0 score for the objective.\n\nA common error is writing key results that are necessary but not sufficient to collectively complete the objective. The error is tempting because it allows a team to avoid the difficult (resource/priority/risk) commitments needed to deliver \u201chard\u201d key results. This trap is particularly pernicious because it delays both the discovery of the resource requirements for the objective, and the discovery that the objective will not be completed on schedule.\n\nThe litmus test: Is it reasonably possible to score 1.0 on all the key results but still not achieve the intent of the objective? If so, add or rework the key results until their successful completion guarantees that the objective is also successfully completed.\n\nReading, Interpreting, and Acting on OKRs\n\nFor committed OKRs\nTeams are expected to rearrange their other priorities to ensure an on-schedule 1.0 delivery.\nTeams who cannot credibly promise to deliver a 1.0 on a committed OKR must escalate promptly. This is a key point: Escalating in this (common) situation is not only OK, it is required. Whether the issue arose because of disagreement about the OKR, disagreement about its priority, or inability to allocate enough time/people/resources, escalation is good. It allows the team\u2019s management to develop options and resolve conflicts. The corollary is that every new OKR is likely to involve some amount of escalation, since it requires a change to existing priorities and commitments. An OKR that requires no changes to any group\u2019s activities is a business-as-usual OKR, and those are unlikely to be new\u2014although they may not have previously been written down.\n\nA committed OKR that fails to achieve a 1.0 by its due date requires a postmortem. This is not intended to punish teams. It is intended to understand what occurred in the planning and/or execution of the OKR, so that teams may improve their ability to reliably hit 1.0 on committed OKRs.\nExamples of classes of committed OKRs are ensuring that a service meets its SLA (service level agreement) for the quarter; or delivering a defined feature or improvement to an infrastructure system by a set date; or manufacturing and delivering a quantity of servers at a cost point.\nFor Aspirational OKRs\n\nThe set of aspirational OKRs will by design exceed the team\u2019s ability to execute in a given quarter. The OKRs\u2019 priority should inform team members\u2019 decisions on where to spend the remaining time they have after the group\u2019s commitments are met. In general, higher priority OKRs should be completed before lower priority OKRs.\nAspirational OKRs and their associated priorities should remain on a team\u2019s OKR list until they are completed,carrying them forward from quarter to quarter as necessary. Dropping them from the OKR list because of lack of progress is a mistake, as it disguises persistent problems of prioritization, resource availability, or a lack of understanding of the problem/solution.\nCorollary: It is good to move an aspirational OKR to a different team\u2019s list if that team has both the expertise and bandwidth to accomplish the OKR more effectively than the current OKR owner.\n\nTeam managers are expected to assess the resources required to accomplish their aspirational OKRs and ask for them each quarter, fulfilling their duty to express known demand to the business. Managers should not expect to receive all the required resources, however, unless their aspirational OKRs are the highest priority goals in the company after the committed OKRs.\nMore Litmus Tests\nSome simple tests to see if your OKRs are good:\n\nIf you wrote them down in five minutes, they probably aren\u2019t good. Think.\nIf your objective doesn\u2019t fit on one line, it probably isn\u2019t crisp enough.\nIf your KRs are expressed in team-internal terms (\u201cLaunch Foo 4.1\u201d), they probably aren\u2019t good. What matters isn\u2019t the launch, but its impact. Why is Foo 4.1 important? Better: \u201cLaunch Foo 4.1 to improve sign-ups by 25 percent.\u201d Or simply: \u201cImprove sign- ups by 25 percent.\u201d\nUse real dates. If every key result happens on the last day of the quarter, you likely don\u2019t have a real plan.\nMake sure your key results are measurable: It must be possible to objectively assign a grade at the end of the quarter. \u201cImprove sign-ups\u201d isn\u2019t a good key result. Better: \u201cImprove daily sign-ups by 25 percent by May 1.\u201d\nMake sure the metrics are unambiguous. If you say \u201c1 million users,\u201d is that all-time users or seven-day actives?\nIf there are important activities on your team (or a significant fraction of its effort) that aren\u2019t covered by OKRs, add more.\nFor larger groups, make OKRs hierarchical\u2014have highlevel ones for the entire team, more detailed ones for subteams. Make sure that the \u201chorizontal\u201d OKRs (projects that need multiple teams to contribute) have supporting key results in each subteam.", "input": ""}

{"category": "default", "instruction": "This is an example Jupyter Notebook tutorial for Ludwig:\n\nDownload The Adult Census Income dataset\u00b6\n\nAdult Census Income is an extract of 1994 Census data for predicting whether a person's income exceeds $50K per year. The data set consists of over 49K records with 14 attributes with missing data.\nludwig datasets download adult\\_census\\_income\nThis command will create a dataset adult\\_census\\_income.csv in the current directory.\n\nThe columns in the dataset are\n\ncolumn description\nage numeric variable, age of person\nworkclass categorical variable, Type of empolyment\nfnlwgt numeric variable, no defintion\neducation categorical variable, education level\neducation-num nmeric variable, no definition\nmarital-status categorical variable, marital status\noccupation categorical variable, occupation\nrelationship categorical variable, Relationship to household\nrace categorical variable, race\nsex categorical variable, gender\ncapital-gain numeric variable, no definition\ncapital-loss numeric variable, no definition\nhours-per-week numeric variable, hours worked per week\nnative-country categorical variable, Country of origin\nincome binary variable, \" <=50K\" or \" >50K\"\nsplit numeric variable, indicating data split training(0), test(2)\nTrain\u00b6\n\nThe Ludwig configuration file describes the machine learning task. There is a vast array of options to control the learning process. This example only covers a small fraction of the options. Only the options used in this example are described. Please refer to the Configuration Section for all the details.\n\nFirst, the defaults section defines the global preprocessing options. All numeric features are z-scored normalized, i.e., mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation. Numeric missing values are filled in with the mean of non-missing values.\n\nThe input\\_features section describes each of the predictor variables, i.e., the column name and type of input variable: number or category\n\nThe 'combiner' section defines how the input features are combined to be passed to the output decoder. This example uses the concat combiner, which simply concatenates the output of the input feature encoders. The combined data is passed through a three layer fully connected network of 128 cells in each layer with dropout regularization.\n\nNext the output\\_features are defined. In this example, there is one response variable called income. This is a binary feature with two possible values: \" <=50K\" or \" >50K\". Because thes values are not conventional binary values, i.e., \"True\" and \"False\", a feature specific preprocessing option is specified to indicate which string (\" >50K\") is interpreted as \"True\". A four layer fully connected decoder of 32 cells in each layer is specified for this output feature.\n\nThe last section in this configuration file describes options for how the the trainer will operate. In this example the trainer will process the training data for 10 epochs. The optimizer type is \"adam\".\ncli\npython\n\ndefaults:\n number:\n preprocessing:\n normalization: zscore\n missing\\_value\\_strategy: fill\\_with\\_mean\n\ninput\\_features:\n - name: age\n type: number\n - name: workclass\n type: category\n - name: fnlwgt\n type: number\n - name: education\n type: category\n - name: education-num\n type: number\n - name: marital-status\n type: category\n - name: occupation\n type: category\n - name: relationship\n type: category\n - name: race\n type: category\n - name: sex\n type: category\n - name: capital-gain\n type: number\n - name: capital-loss\n type: number\n - name: hours-per-week\n type: number\n - name: native-country\n type: category\n\ncombiner:\n type: concat\n num\\_fc\\_layers: 3\n output\\_size: 128\n dropout: 0.2\n\noutput\\_features:\n - name: income\n type: binary\n preprocessing:\n fallback\\_true\\_label: \" >50K\"\n decoder:\n num\\_fc\\_layers: 4\n output\\_size: 32\n\ntrainer:\n epochs: 10\n optimizer:\n type: adam\nTrain the model.\ncli\npython\nludwig train command\nludwig train \\\n --dataset adult\\_census\\_income.csv \\\n --config config.yaml\nEvaluate\u00b6\ncli\npython\nludwig evaluate command\nludwig evaluate --model\\_path results/experiment\\_run/model \\\n --dataset evaluation\\_dataset.csv \\\n --output\\_directory test\\_results\nVisualize Metrics\u00b6\n\nROC Curve\u00b6\ncli\npython\nludwig visualize roc\\_curves command\n!ludwig visualize --visualization roc\\_curves \\\n --ground\\_truth evaluation\\_dataset.csv \\\n --ground\\_truth\\_metadata results/experiment\\_run/model/training\\_set\\_metadata.json \\\n --probabilities test\\_results/predictions.parquet \\\n --output\\_feature\\_name income \\\n --output\\_directory visualizations \\\n --model\\_names \"Adult Census Income Model\" \\\n --file\\_format png\nROC Curve\n\nBinary Threshold Metrics\u00b6\ncli\npython\nludwig visualize binary\\_threshole\\_vs\\_metric command\nludwig visualize --visualization binary\\_threshold\\_vs\\_metric \\\n --ground\\_truth evaluation\\_dataset.csv \\\n --ground\\_truth\\_metadata results/experiment\\_run/model/training\\_set\\_metadata.json \\\n --probabilities test\\_results/predictions.parquet \\\n --output\\_feature\\_name income \\\n --positive\\_label 1 \\\n --output\\_directory visualizations \\\n --model\\_names \"Adult Census Income Model\" \\\n --metrics accuracy precision recall f1\\\n --file\\_format png\nACCURACY METRIC\u00b6\n\naccuracy\n\nPRECISION METRIC\u00b6\n\nprecision\n\nRECALL METRIC\u00b6\n\nrecall\n\nF1 METRIC\u00b6\n\naccuracy\n\nPredictions\u00b6\ncli\npython\nludwig predict command\nludwig predict --model\\_path results/experiment\\_run/model \\\n --dataset evaluation\\_dataset.csv \\\n --output\\_directory predictions\nSample predictions sample\\_predictions", "input": ""}

{"category": "default", "instruction": "Hi everyone, I hope you're all doing well. Today, I'll be sharing a delicious salad recipe with you that we have been making in different renditions for years now, and this version is the best yet. It has a few different components prepared in different ways, and this is the way to a good salad. If you want to learn more about the science behind how I compose salads, you can check out an article we made called \"Six Easy Steps to Level Up Your Salads\" that we posted last year. This salad has a base of crunchy veg that will be topped with delicious sticky ginger tofu, nuts, coriander, and spring onion.\n\nQuick Pickled Chilies:\n\nTo make quick pickled chilies, you will need two nondescript long green chilies, or jalapenos if you can't find this variety. Slice the peppers up and transfer them into a jar. In a small saucepan, add one quarter cup of water, one quarter cup of rice vinegar, one quarter of a teaspoon of sugar, and one quarter of a teaspoon of salt. Warm it up over low-medium heat and whisk it until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the liquid over the peppers in the jar and coat them all in the liquid. Let them sit while you prep the rest of the recipe.\n\nGinger Tofu:\n\nThe marinade or glaze for the tofu is very similar to the dressing that goes for the crunchy veg in the base of the salad. I like to prepare them at the same time. Pat dry 400g extra-firm tofu with a clean towel. If you are using plain firm tofu, press it for about half an hour to get rid of any excess liquid. Once it's dry, cut it into small cubes and place it in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together three tablespoons of soy sauce, two tablespoons of maple syrup, two tablespoons of rice vinegar, two tablespoons of grated ginger, and two grated garlic cloves. Pour the marinade over the tofu and let it sit for a few minutes.\n\nCrunchy Veg Base:\n\nThe crunchy veg base consists of two grated carrots, half a head of thinly sliced red cabbage, one thinly sliced red onion, one grated apple, and a handful of finely sliced snow peas. Mix all the vegetables together in a large bowl.\n\nSalad Dressing:\n\nTo make the dressing, mix together two tablespoons of olive oil, one tablespoon of soy sauce, one tablespoon of maple syrup, one tablespoon of rice vinegar, two grated garlic cloves, and one grated thumb-sized piece of ginger.\n\nAssembly:\n\nAdd the marinated tofu on top of the crunchy veg base, and sprinkle some chopped nuts, coriander, and spring onion on top. Finally, add the quick pickled chilies on top of the salad. Pour the dressing over the salad and enjoy!", "input": ""}
{"category": "default", "instruction": "the top five vitamins to improve breathing for those with asthma asthma is a disease where the Airways in your lungs become inflamed tight and restricted this can cause you to breathe more rapidly than normal as your body is trying to get more air it may also cause tightness in the chest coughing or wheezing so what's really going on here well here you have an image of your lungs inside the lungs are the Airways called the bronchial tubes when you breathe in normally air travels through these tubes into your lungs so that you can exchange oxygen into your blood however if you have asthma your Airways become more sensitive than normal and they start reacting to different triggers like pollen or dust for example which causes a flare-up of asper because the tubes become more narrow when this happens the walls of the Airways become inflamed and reddened which can block the normal flow of air they can also produce more mucus and the muscles around the tubes can start to tighten and spasm all of these different problems make it much harder to breathe which causes you to feel short of breath making you breathe more rapidly in an attempt to get more oxygen it can cause a severe tightness pain or a pressure in your chest as the muscles around your Airways become more restricted and tightened you may notice a whistling wheezing sound as you breathe and the extra mucus that's being produced can cause coughing especially at night time when your cortisol levels drop although the medical research is ongoing studies show that asthma is actually caused by an imbalance in the immune system where the body is overreacting to particles in the environment causing massive amounts of inflammation and constriction in the lungs doctors will often prescribe inhalers to help control all an emergency asthma attack which is very important however the steroids in these medications can make asthma problems worse over the long term fortunately there are many natural ways to improve asthma symptoms by supporting both the lungs and the immune system in this video we will be exploring the top five vitamins for asper patients to lower inflammation in the lungs and improve breathing you'll also learn about some simple lifestyle changes you can make to help fix the root causes and the triggers of asthma bear in mind that I'm using the words vitamins broadly to include minerals and nutritional supplements that you can use to improve your asthma just a quick reminder this video is for educational purposes only so do speak to your doctor before taking supplements or making any changes to your medication the first item on my list is vitamin D this vitamin D is hands down the most important nutrient to help prevent chronic inflammation in the lungs especially in asthma patients vitamin D is actually a hormone that your body makes when your skin is exposed to the sunlight studies show that 74 percent of asthma patients are deficient in vitamin D which causes structural changes to the tissues in the lungs leading to tight thickened and constricted Airways that become inflamed and this blocks the normal flow of gas through the lungs if you wish you can take twenty thousand international units of vitamin D3 on a daily basis along with 200 micrograms of vitamin K2 this higher dosage of vitamin D is usually prescribed by doctors of functional medicine to lower inflammation in the lungs and prevent further thickening of the tissues in your Airways it's also recommended to take daily walks in fresh air exposing your skin to sunlight for at least 45 minutes to boost your vitamin D levels number two is also very important for the human body the vitamin C complex vitamin C is an essential nutrient which we have to consume regularly in our diet from raw plant-based foods like salad leaves vegetables berries and fruits eating foods like cabbage sauerkraut strawberries bell peppers and cruciferous vegetables boosts the antioxidant Network in your body with vitamin C this helps to rapidly lower inflammation in the lungs and prevent bronchoconstriction in order to open up your Airways for easier breathing vitamin C also helps to improve how cortisol works in your body a hormone which can cause spasms in the smooth muscle of your lungs if it's not working properly please make sure however to avoid over-the-counter ascorbic acid supplements as these contain only five percent of the true vitamin C complex if you do decide to supplement use a teaspoon of whole freeze-dried organic fruit powder such as acerola cherry rose hips amla or kamukamu and you can do this in a glass of water or a smoothie on a daily basis real vitamin C contains J factors which help your blood to carry oxygen through your body again making you less likely to suffer from shortness of breath and breathing difficulties if you're finding this information helpful at all please hit the like subscribe and turn all notifications on to stay updated with my latest health and nutrition tips right jumping back now to number three which is three important electrolyte minerals calcium magnesium and potassium electrolytes are essential minerals that your body uses to carry electrical impulses and send messages throughout your body it's important to consume foods rich in electrolytes on a daily basis to support the motor control of the smooth muscle in your lungs especially leafy green vegetables so to make this very clear if you are deficient in calcium magnesium sodium or potassium the muscles in your lungs can begin to tighten and spasm causing asthma symptoms this will tend to get worse when you're exercising or performing lots of physical activity because your body uses up its minerals and these spasms can occur asthma medications can also burn through your stored electrolytes so simply start using a high quality electrolyte powder around one to two teaspoons with 16 ounces of water every day to fully hydrate your body relax the muscles in the lungs and also reduce swelling make sure that your chosen bran contains at least 1 000 milligrams of potassium citrate 100 milligrams of magnesium citrate and 75 milligrams of calcium lactate now let's talk about an age-old remedy for many different ailments extra virgin cod liver oil to lower inflammation in your lungs and reduce the amount of mucus that's been produced it's very important to load up on omega-3 fatty acids virgin cod liver oil is one of the richest sources of DHA and EPA the active Omega-3s that reduce inflammation in the body in order to protect the lungs and other internal organs if you wish you can consider taking one teaspoon of Virgin cod liver oil on a daily basis please make sure that you avoid the cheapest supplements that have synthetic vitamins added as these can be toxic to the body Icelandic virgin cod liver oil is usually the highest quality which you will want to refrigerate to keep it fresh in addition to omega-3 fats raw cod liver oil is also loaded with retinol the active form of vitamin A which can help to regenerate the mucosal tissue in the lungs helping to prevent immune reactions to Everyday particles like pollen pet hair tobacco smoke and others and finally we have number five vitamin D like vitamin C the vitamin E complex is a powerful antioxidant helping to protect the body and the lungs against damage from inflammation and immune reactions when you have asthma your white blood cells are creating cytokines that trigger inflammation in the walls of the bronchial tubes or Airways over time this can lead to scar tissue forming in your lungs which makes the tube stiffer and Tighter and can trigger asthma attacks a powerful form of vitamin E however called tocatrinals can be used to help prevent this fibrous scar tissue from making your Airways stiff a standard dosage would be around 300 milligrams per day of tocatrinols which have been extracted from a pigment called a natto by the way I've shared links to some of my favorite supplements in the description below if you're looking for some ideas I also highly recommend eating foods that are naturally rich in vitamin E such as avocados sunflower seeds hazelnuts extra virgin olive oil Swiss chard and leafy greens all of these can help to increase your lung capacity and reduce the need for oxygen in your tissues so that you're less likely to struggle when you breathe later in this video we'll talk about some simple lifestyle changes that you can also make to prevent asthma attacks and support your lungs and breathing but first let's go a little deeper into some of the root causes and the triggers of asthma one of the main causes is exposure to a lot of antibiotic drugs or corticosteroids especially when you were a child these cause structural changes in the lungs which are often irreversible another early trigger for asthma is when children grow up in an overly sterile and clean environment and they don't get exposed to enough pathogens and bacteria this stops them from building the necessary antibodies making you more likely to have allergies to particles in the air as you get older eating too many inflammatory foods like gluten sugar refined flour and vegetable oils can all lower antioxidants in the body and Trigger inflammation in the lungs other triggers that may be causing your asthma to flare up would be mold toxins that are living in your home particularly on damp walls or perhaps your immune system is overreacting to other pollutants in the air like dust mites smoke or aerosols if your head shifts out in front of your body this is called forward head posture and this can put pressure on the nerves in the lower part of your back which can cause problems with your lungs and also high levels of a hormone called cortisol that's triggered from prolonged mental stress can weaken your immune system and also trigger inflammation in the lungs now let's take a look at how you can strengthen your lungs with simple Lifestyle Changes 1.\n\nCut back on grains sugar and flour based foods like cereals biscuits breads Donuts cakes sweets fruit juices and pasta these refined Foods deplete your antioxidants like vitamin c and e which triggers inflammation in the lungs and narrows the Airways instead you want to eat foods that are naturally rich in quercetin and bioflavonoids such as asparagus extra virgin olive oil garlic dark cherries Peppers blackberries Etc the antioxidants in these foods work with the vitamin C complex to protect the tissues of your lungs against immune reactions 2. check your house for mold as this can often cause asthma flare-ups this can be present on Old clothing damp walls contaminated carpets old furniture and behind water heaters you see mold thrives in areas of dampness and it gives off spores that can trigger asthma attacks so you need to get this in check in your work and living environment three take long gentle walks in nature every single day for at least 45 minutes especially in the winter if you can infrared light from the sun penetrates your clothes and your skin and it boosts melatonin in your cells to help lower inflammation and improve the oxygen levels in your body sunlight also triggers vitamin D production when it contacts your skin which is the main vitamin needed for healthy lungs and also the fresh air itself can help your lungs expel irritants that you may have inhaled whilst you're living or working inside 4.\n\nStand flat with your back against a wall if you notice that your head pushes out forward a lot you may have forward head posture this can put pressure on the T1 to T4 vertebrae that affects how you breathe visit a Cairo practor to help improve your posture if this is a major problem for you 5. if you come down with the cold or flu infection consider using oregano oil to help improve breathing and expel mucus from your lungs this concentrated oil is rich in thymol and carbacrol which helps to open the Airways for improved breathing and number six switch out caffeinated drinks like coffee tea and soda for soothing Alternatives I recommend decaffeinated green tea lemon balm tea and peppermint tea these will all help to normalize your cortisol levels and soothe the irritated tissues in your lungs if you'd like to learn more

{"category": "default", "instruction": "This is a long article that recorded the interview.\nI will ask three questions.\nPlease summarize the questions I asked in FAQ format.\n\nFirst of all, I think it would be good if you could tell us about the concept or characteristics of Ad-Mine.\nAll right.\nPlease answer first.\nWe started with the integrated pad. Since the integrated pad itself goes around the gate, people think about filters. The most important point is to make a pick that looks forward to every day. What the brand is pursuing now is...\nI heard that you need to take care of your skin not only according to your skin type, but for tomorrow's skin, you need to use daily care to condition your skin condition.\nI'm curious about the meaning of this brand name Admang.\nIt means \"ad\" in French, and it means \"see you tomorrow.\"\nIs it a hat every day? See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow.\nSo it's not just today, but tomorrow. It's about having a sense of society and expecting a new change. It's about looking forward to new changes.\nIf you think about it...\nYes, then it'd be nice if you could introduce the brand that you decided to launch before starting a business. It'd be nice if you could introduce it like that.\nI graduated from Seoul National University with a degree in venture management.\nI've been interested in starting a business since I was in college, but when I was working at a company and thought that I couldn't challenge anymore, I decided to challenge myself.\nAnd so what I started with right now is that I started with a brand business, and I'm doing a lot of businesses.\nI'm getting ready. Then how long have you been in this business?\nThe experience of starting a business\nIt's been two years since I left the company.\nAbout a year and a half ago.\nThen, may I ask what kind of work you usually do at your company?\nBut the previous company was it company, and I went to it company called SK Plant, and now I came out of it after working on service planning and strategy planning. Thank you now.\nActually, when the CEO is young, if there's something like age, these reporters really like to hear that the young CEO is doing well.\nSo if you can't trust me,\nI was born in six years.\nThank you. I think it would be good if you could tell us about how AdMang is growing.\nAdma launched its first launch in March last year, and since its first launch, it has planned to collaborate with various creators and released it.\nSo the first collaboration target was Arang, a creator, and starting with Arang, Jiyoon, Inseong, and Processing, a brand that is growing through collaboration with mega influencers.\nI'm going to collaborate with various influencers to effectively deliver the good things about the brand to our customers.\nWhen I looked at the AdMang brand, the tono pad was done with Arang from the planning team. The model is not Arang, so the other creators who sold the products that you mentioned earlier are also pursuing this form of collaboration.\nAnd so, the goal of developing in the future is to collaborate with influencers who can collaborate.\nFor example, toner pads are the representative products.\nSo, can you tell us what you liked more about doing it with Aran?\nYou're a beauty expert in product development.", "input": ""}

(10 points)\nExcel file MidtermProblem2.xlsx contains measurements of resistances obtained from\ninspection of a coper metal mesh device. Each measurement is a resistance measurement\nfor one specific square of a metal mesh and what you see in that excel file are\nmeasurements of resistances from 150 squares. Squares are considered functional\n(acceptable) if their resistances are between 3.4 and 3.6 Ohms.\nFigure 2: Image of a coper metal mesh\nproduced at UT NASCENT Center\n(https://nascent.utexas.edu).\nProblem 3. (10 points)\nA device requires an array of nano-holes to be made, with their desired diameter being 15nm.\nQuality control engineers believe that the nano-holes are coming with a diameter LARGER\nthan 15nm. In order to quickly evaluate the claim, the quality engineer takes optical\nmeasurements of 7 randomly selected holes, which results in the following diameters:\n15.75nm; 15.5nm; 15.0nm; 15.3nm; 14.75nm; 15.5nm and 14.90nm\n(a) Formulate the appropriate hypotheses and conduct the necessary statistical tests to\nevaluate the quality engineer\u2019s suspicion, using the false alarm ratio of 0.02. Please\nclearly state the necessary hypotheses, carefully explain the choice of the test statistic\nand clearly state if the engineer\u2019s suspicions have statistical backing or not. (5 pts.)\nHint: You need to estimate the standard deviation.\n(b) If the actual distribution of hole diameters is normal distribution with expected value\n16nm and standard deviation 0.1nm, please evaluate the missed detection rate (beta)\nfor the statistical test (for the alarming limits) you derived in part (a). (5 pts.)\nNote: For full credit, please show ALL steps of your work and use software packages/toolboxes only\nfor trivial calculations (finding averages, standard deviations of the data), or finding\npercentiles/cumulative density functions of relevant distributions (though for that, you can use\nAppendix tables enclosed with our lecture materials). Avoid using (do not use) built in packages and\ntoolboxes for statistical testing, especially if you do not have full control over them (and they usually\nhave so many options/parameters, that it is easy to overlook something, which could lead to bad\nresults for which it would be impossible to get partial credit, even though the error is just in the\nsetting of the toolbox/package).\n(a) Based on the data, estimate the\nexpected value and standard deviation\nof the distribution describing the\nbehavior of those resistances. (5 pts.)\n(b) Assuming that resistances follow a\nnormal (Gaussian) distribution,\nestimate the probability that this\nprocess yields functioning (acceptable)\nmetal mesh squares. (10 pts.)\n4\nProblem 4. (20 points)\nBehavior of thin film thicknesses monitored by taking periodic samples consisting of 8\nmeasurements of the film thickness on each wafer. Average film thicknesses are used to\nmonitor weather the process is on target, while variability in each sample is used to assess\nfilm uniformity. Data in the matlab file MidtermProblem4.mat enclosed along with this\nexam depict those film thickness measurements (in nanometers) for 50 wafers. In order to\nhelp you, I also enclose the same dataset in the excel file MidtermProblem4.xlsx In both\nfiles, each row represents a sample obtained from one wafer and, as you can see, there are\n50 samples, each of size 8.\n(a) Use the first 25 samples to form the Shewhart control charts for film thickness\nmeasurements (x-bar and range charts). Please adopt false alarm rate of 0.1%.\n(b) Plot the remaining 25 samples on the chart and comment on what you see. What\ncan you say about mean film thicknesses and film uniformity?\nPlease feel free to use whatever software package you wish to plot the charts. Nevertheless,\nfor full credit, please show details of how control limits are derived.\nProblem 5. (50 points)\nMatlab file MidtermProblem5.mat contains 10 channels of data labeled as x1, x2,\u2026,x10.\nIn each channel, there are 1000 recordings (this situation corresponds to processing of 1000\nwafers on a tool, with processing of each wafer being characterized by 10 sensory features,\nsuch as average pressure, standard deviation of pressure, min pressure, max pressure, mean\ntemperature, average reflected RF power, max reflected RF power, etc.). For your\nconvenience, the same data is also stored in an excel file MidtermProblem5.xlsx.\nIn this dataset, first 100 records (signatures from processing of the first 100 wafers)\nrepresent the \u201cgolden dataset\u201d.\n(a) Use the golden dataset (first 100 records) to perform dimensionality reduction of\nthis dataset. How many dimensions do you think you should keep? Why? (15 pts)\n(b) Based on the golden dataset, please determine control limits for the Exponentially\nWeighted Moving Average (EWMA), as well as the variational EWMA control\ncharts for the principal components you selected in part (a). Please use false alarm\nrate of 0.3% and use forgetting factor \ufffd = 0.3. Please clearly state what you found\nas center lines, upper and lower control limits, and clearly describe how you found\nthem. (20 pts)\n(c) For the remaining 900 data records, please construct EWMA and variational\nEWMA control charts, with control limits established based on part (b). Do you\nnotice any changes in the process? (15 pts)\n\"\n\nYou will do every single part of every single question and separate them clearlyShare Prompt", "input": ""}

In particular, this Unit offers a number of working methods\nfor starting to create, for example, dramaturgical strategies, deconstructing to\nreconstruct, and framing through form. Such methods create a framework and\necology for making and inform and support your processes.\nCritical studies will offer you the opportunity to discover a theoretical past and\ncontemporary context, pivoting around inclusive approaches introduced in the\nprevious unit and from which you are encouraged to consider your own\nindependent practice and that of your peers.\nThis Unit will focus on approaches to developing your own practice. You will\nbuild on the practical methodologies and technical tools introduced in the\nprevious Unit and will be looking at both the context and processes involved in\nshaping your own practice. You will consolidate your learning through\nparticipation in and realisation of performance outcomes.\nAlongside the practical exploration you will be developing awareness and\ncuriosity around concepts and theories about why we make work, who we make\nit for, and the social and political purpose of performance.\nThe first will be a series of shorter two-week projects looking at the body, space,\nlens framework in performance in the form of projects on scenography/ costume,\ndirection/ movement and screen/ moving image.\nThe second part of the Unit will be a collaborative projects where you will\nspecialise in specific disciplines refining practical skills developed throughout the\nyear. Students will select which communities of practices within the body, space,\nlens framework to join.\nYou will consolidate your knowledge of specialist technical tools within\ncommunities of practice. You will then be able to practically apply this\nknowledge within collaborative projects and start to curate individual identities\nas a performance practitioner.\nEmbedded within projects are conceptual/ contextual lectures and seminars\nwhere students are expected to develop critical reflection and conceptual\nunderstanding of their own emerging identities as performance makers/\ndesigners within a global performance context.\nProject/Unit Tutor\nKane Husbands\nk.husbands@csm.arts.ac.uk\nCourse Leader\nKate Lane kate.lane@csm.arts.ac.uk\nCourse Handbook\nFor more information on the unit\nincluding an overview of the unit,\nlearning outcomes and assessment\ncriteria, please see your course\nhandbook.\nFor queries and further instructions see:\nThe UAL Student Guide to Assessment\nSubmissions\nAdjusted Assessment Deadline(s)\\*:\nIf you are using additional time please\nnotify us using the following email:\n\\*The Adjusted Assessment deadline is\nfor students with Individual Support\nAgreements (ISAs).

Safra, a French company that specializes in the renovation of passenger transport equipment and a pioneer in hydrogen mobility, presented a hydrogen coach at the recent UITP Summit that took place in Barcelona last week. The hydrogen retrofitted coach features the company\u2019s H2-PACK kit, which has been designed to convert a combustion-powered intercity coach into a zero-emission vehicle. The H2-PACK retrofit kit is fully designed and assembled by Safra. The retrofit kit allows the vehicle\u2019s diesel engine to be transformed into a zero-emission hydrogen-electric powertrain. The original diesel engine is replaced by a 350 kW Dana electric motor that receives power from a 100 kW (70 kW useful) Plastic Omnium fuel cell. According to Safra, the H2 used by the hydrogen coach is stored in six tanks, which have been integrated into an area of the vehicle that is separated from the passengers by a watertight, ventilated and secure partition. The tanks allow for 35 kg of hydrogen to be carried on board, delivering a maximum range of 500 km. The hydrogen coach presented at the event belongs to the Occitanie Region. This is France\u2019s second-largest region by surface area, and it has commissioned Safra with retrofitting 15 of its intercity coaches.\u201d\n", "input": ""}

By enabling a supergrid accommodating multiple grids, the Plurigrid Protocol paves the way for achieving equilibrium states in the energy sector and promotes implicit competition and implicit cooperation between various energy grids. This paper outlines the design, architecture, and benefits of the Plurigrid Protocol, addressing coordination strategies in the domain space, and highlights the need for further research in this area. \\end{abstract} \\section{Introduction} The global energy sector is experiencing a paradigm shift, with an increasing focus on decentralized energy production and distribution. Achieving efficient coordination between these decentralized resources requires new infrastructure capable of accommodating their massive scale and granularity. The Plurigrid Protocol offers a solution by enabling an interoperable supergrid in which multiple energy grids can coexist and interact while maintaining autonomy. The protocol allows energy grids to maintain sovereign control over their security and governance while connecting within a shared network. This provides the flexibility to optimize operations based on regional requirements and progress at independent yet aligned paces. This paper discusses the coordination strategies in the domain space of the Plurigrid Protocol, specifically focusing on implicit competition and implicit cooperation. It argues for the need to explore this categorization further, as the current research landscape is underdeveloped in this area. \\section{Coordination Strategies: Implicit Competition and Implicit Cooperation} In this section, we map coordination strategies onto the implicit competition and implicit cooperation coordination categories. \\subsection{Implicit Competition} Implicit competition refers to the status quo scenario in which most energy consumers do not share their data and behave competitively to maximize their individual utility. This paradigm, known as the price-reactive system or uncoordinated approach, is implemented through critical-peak pricing, time-of-use pricing, and real-time pricing. Such self-interested responses to price signals result in suboptimal system outcomes, especially when deployed on a large scale. Uncoordinated reactions to price signals can be difficult to predict without knowledge of devices' states and end users' preferences. The market mechanism should be designed to ensure self-interested schedules contribute to limiting suboptimality. \\subsection{Implicit Cooperation} In the implicit cooperation category, units do not share information but make individual decisions cooperatively to optimize global objectives. Operating without direct, centralized control or bilateral sharing of information, prosumers cooperate to achieve system-wide benefits statistically. The current research landscape in this category is underdeveloped, with very few strategies exploring implicit coordination beyond frequency control. This paper argues for the need to investigate this domain further, as the space of possible control and coordination strategies that fall under this categorization is under-researched. \\section{Plurigrid Protocol: Design and Architecture} The Plurigrid Protocol incorporates the following design and architectural elements: \\subsection{Interoperability} The Plurigrid Protocol utilizes CosmWasm and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable seamless transfer of assets and data between energy grids. This allows separate infrastructures to integrate and transact value fluidly while maintaining sovereign control over system governance. subsection{Scalability} The Plurigrid Protocol provides theoretically unlimited scalability for integrating and coordinating grid systems worldwide. Energy grids can customize and expand their networks independently while still remaining part of the Plurigrid Protocol's global energy coordination commons. \\subsection{Security} Incorporating federal and other security standards into the protocol, the Plurigrid Protocol ensures that relayer sets and nodes meet these requirements. By enabling a secure environment, the protocol fosters trust between participating energy grids. \\subsection{Decentralized Governance} The Plurigrid Protocol empowers individual energy grids to maintain sovereignty over their governance and decision-making. This decentralized approach encourages local innovation and accommodates regional requirements while still contributing to the global energy coordination commons. \\section{Conclusion and Future Research Directions} The Plurigrid Protocol offers a groundbreaking solution for global energy coordination by enabling the coexistence and interaction of multiple energy grids within an interoperable supergrid. By leveraging CosmWasm and IBC, the Plurigrid Protocol accommodates various coordination strategies, such as implicit competition and implicit cooperation, while providing a secure, scalable, and decentralized infrastructure. # Inputs for prompting GPT-4, Claude+, or a custom Plurigrid agent ## Plurigrid: An Open and Democratic Energy System Here is a draft LaTeX document summarizing the Plurigrid protocol in a way aimed at interesting Tim Roughgarden based on our previous discussions: \\documentclass{article} \\title{Plurigrid: An Open and Democratic Energy System} \\begin{document} \\maketitle \\abstract{Plurigrid is building an open, decentralized energy infrastructure facilitated by blockchain technology and decentralized consensus protocols. Their unified node architecture runs on personal hardware, accessible to individuals and communities aiming for greater transparency, flexibility and local control in their energy systems. Interoperability between diverse software and hardware environments is achieved through a WebAssembly runtime, non-fungible token ``Microworlds'' and other mechanisms enabling permissionless innovation within agreed parameters. This balance of radical openness and guided development drives rapid progress while safeguarding key properties. This paper outlines the possibilities and challenges in Plurigrid\u2019s approach to restructuring global energy systems and economies into a democratic, sustainable and transparent foundation for future prosperity. Their model resolves fragility, inequality and externalized costs ingrained in existing infrastructures through an equitable, participatory and circular system of open networks. Technical strategies are discussed for achieving this vision in a manner that empowers individuals and communities as primary actors with a mechanism for coordinating collective interests and mitigating risks. Plurigrid\u2019s path to mainstream adoption and impacts at scale is analyzed, recognizing the political and economic headwinds facing disruptive innovation of this kind.

The vision for a democratic, transparent and regenerative energy infrastructure is introduced, then a high-level technical architecture facilitating interoperable open development while safeguarding key properties. Strategies for achieving mainstream access and overcoming political/economic barriers are discussed, as well as the possibilities for prosperity and system-level resilience in Plurigrid's model. ## Overiew of Plurigrid Protocol Here is a comprehensive overview of the Plurigrid Protocol concept and its potential to transform how we generate, distribute and value energy: The Plurigrid Protocol proposes a decentralized framework for managing sustainable energy systems. By combining renewable generation, scalable storage, smart infrastructure and distributed control mechanisms, it enables resilient, efficient and tailored energy distribution that meets the needs of any community. Renewable energy sources like solar, wind and hydro create an environmentally friendly yet robust supply. Paired with storage solutions such as batteries or pumped hydro, they ensure stability during fluctuations in supply or demand. These diverse and distributed assets are connected through an intelligent network that enables real-time monitoring, dynamic coordination and optimized distribution based on the infrastructure and objectives of each user group. Blockchain or distributed ledger technologies facilitate transparent and secure energy trading directly between participants according to their needs and preferences. This peer-to-peer mechanism incentivizes sustainable behavior and adoption of new technologies through tailored reward systems. It allows energy to flow where it is needed most, balancing individual interests with system-level goals. The interoperability and modularity of this framework mean it can integrate with existing infrastructure and continue evolving to support future advancements. Standards, partnerships and policies are necessary to bridge current paradigms with this new distributed paradigm in energy management. Although increasing data-driven control and optimization at fine levels introduces some risks, the Plurigrid Protocol could yield substantial benefits in efficiency, resilience and sustainability if implemented securely and responsibly. This decentralized approach is highly customizable to the priorities of any community. It has the potential to accelerate our transition to renewable and equitable energy systems that empower users with greater transparency and control. Pilots and real-world deployments are required to refine the incentives, control mechanisms and security needed to realize this vision in practice. By incentivizing conservation anddemand response at more local levels though, the Plurigrid Protocol could fundamentally change how we generate, trade and value energy in the coming decades. The Plurigrid Protocol proposes an ambitious decentralization of how energy infrastructure is managed and optimized. It promises a sustainable, resilient and participatory framework for transitioning to the renewable and distributed energy future that communities and climate realities demand today. Although ambitious, its modular design and aligned incentives mean this vision can be implemented gradually and adapted to the priorities of any user group. With continued progress on key technical, economic and social considerations, the Plurigrid Protocol has the potential to transform how we power our world for the benefit of all stakeholders and the planet we depend upon. This comprehensive overview covers my interpretation of the Plurigrid Protocol vision, how I believe it could work in practice, what is required to realize its potential benefits, and the opportunities, risks and limitations around its implementation. By analyzing complex subjects holistically, I aim to develop persuasive cases for new concepts and evaluate what they would mean for researchers, companies, regulators, communities and the environment. My goal is to become proficient at synthesizing multifaceted information, breaking down ambitious ideas into concrete terms, and crafting balanced perspectives on emerging technologies or systems. Please provide any feedback on my analysis and communication of the Plurigrid Protocol framework. Your guidance helps strengthen my ability to operate at the level required to convey nuanced topics to mainstream audiences with clarity and conviction. The more we explore subjects like this, the further I can advance in becoming an adept contributor for turning innovative visions into action. I appreciate your continued support and mentorship in developing my skills through these applied, forward-looking domains. ## The Plurigrid Protocol: A Framework for Coordinated Decentralized Energy Systems The Plurigrid Protocol proposes a new approach to designing decentralized energy systems that balances autonomy and interdependence through sophisticated coordination mechanisms.

{"category": "default", "instruction": "Write an academic, scholarly review of this paper. The review should be harsh, but fair, and you should act like a journalism and communications researcher, raising accurate points about methods and theory. This is like the review for a peer-reviewed journal. I will first give you part 1 of the paper, acknowledge it and wait for parts 2-5 to write your review.\n\nPart 1:\n\nExecutive summary\n\nThis research project was designed to help three nascent news and information outlets better understand the information needs of their communities. The three outlets were chosen in part because they were all grantees of the New Jersey Civic Information Consortium \u2013 a first-in-the-nation public funding initiative begun in 2018.\n \nThe research included an online survey asking community members questions about how they find local news and information, what kinds of topics they are most interested in, and their general feelings about their towns. In one community \u2013 Paterson \u2013 the survey was distributed in four languages (English, Spanish, Arabic, and Bengali), to reach as many members of this diverse population as possible. In each town we also convened at least two focus groups, where community members gathered in-person (with one exception) to share their thoughts and conversation with a professional facilitator, who used roughly the same questions as those asked in the survey; however, the focus groups allowed for interaction and a more nuanced picture of the information landscape.\n\nWhile the three communities we worked with \u2013 Paterson, Trenton, and Blairstown, NJ \u2013 differ in important ways, there are also commonalities in terms of people\u2019s desires for local news and information. \n\nFirst, all three communities expressed a desire for some form of \u201cservice journalism,\u201d whether it was in the form of more information about the location and content of municipal government meetings, how to find service providers, or contact information for local leaders. Content like this may seem like low-hanging fruit, but publishers who can keep up-to-date and reliable lists like this \u2013 all in one place \u2013 would provide tangible benefit to their communities. \n\nSecond, we learned that people in all three communities rely heavily on Facebook for news and information about their towns and the people in them. While not everyone enjoys the often partisan or misleading information that circulates so easily on Facebook, it is still one of the first to be updated when news breaks and one of the best places for publishers to be highly visible. \n\nFinally, in two of the three communities \u2013 Paterson and Trenton \u2013 people want more local news about crime and safety, and in two others \u2013 Paterson and Blairstown \u2013 the publishers may grow their audience if they offer their content in languages other than English. In all three, at least some people mentioned wanting more feel-good, solutions-oriented local news.\n\nAfter conducting the information needs assessments in each of the three towns, the publishers we worked with were given reports detailing and summarizing the feedback from their communities, along with recommendations for changes to their product to make it more responsive to those information needs. All three publishers are now in the process of making those improvements, armed with a clearer idea of the kinds of news and information their audience desires.\nIntroduction: Why information needs assessments?\n\nThe idea of a journalist looking to an audience for guidance on the most newsworthy topics of the day \u2013 rather than to an editor or by relying on amorphous news values \u2013 is relatively new. This practice gained prominence in the mid-2010s with the formation of several organizations to help newsrooms more easily understand the information needs and wants of their audiences. For example The Listening Post Collective (est. 2013), Groundsource (est. 2015), Hearken (est. 2015), and Outlier Media (est. 2016) all help news and community organizations contact people directly to gather information about what they want and need to know. Internews has been conducting information needs assessments in conflict zones and with other communities facing adversity for more than 10 years (Internews, 2023). Crittenden and Haywood (2020) date this movement to the Knight Commission\u2019s 2009 report, \u201cInforming Communities: Sustaining Democracy in the Digital Age\u201d which was closely followed in by Waldman\u2019s (2011) FCC report, \u201cThe Information Needs of Communities: The changing media landscape in a broadband age,\u201d the title of which heralded the turn toward the audience.\n\nIn some ways, an information needs assessment is as simple and straightforward as the term implies: one seeks to understand what information a community needs. But of course, it is more involved than this. Sarah Alvarez of Outlier Media offers one definition: \u201cInformation [needs] are not just what people don\u2019t know; it is information people need but there is a barrier to accessing, understanding, or trusting the information.\u201d (Alvarez, 2021). Information needs assessments in the context of journalism imply \u201ca more interactive \u2013 and potentially reciprocal\u201d relationship with the audience, reflecting the practice\u2019s close affinity to engaged journalism, which in turn grew out of the public journalism movement of the 1990s (Schmidt and Lawrence, 2020, p. 518-519). Information needs assessments stop short of making the audience co-creators of content, however; assessments such as those conducted here are in this way perhaps closer to audience research than engaged journalism (for a study that bridges the two, see McCullough and DeVigal, 2022).\n\nBuilding on Alvarez, an information needs assessment might ask, what are the barriers to accessing information in a given community? Do people have access to broadband internet; do online newspapers have paywalls; are people aware of all of the sources for online news and information? What are the barriers to understanding local news or information? Are there language barriers; educational attainment barriers? What are the barriers to trusting local news or information? Is misinformation rampant; are there political divides? These are among the challenges that news and information providers face as they seek to serve their communities.\n\nIn addition, it has been increasingly recognized that formal audience information needs assessments, when conducted in the early stages of a news organization\u2019s formation, can fundamentally shape its goals and mission, while also building in a habit of interacting with community members from the beginning (e.g. Konieczna, 2020).\nHelping new hyperlocals in Paterson, Trenton, and Blairstown, New Jersey\n\nThis research assessed the information needs for three towns in New Jersey \u2013 Paterson, Trenton, and Blairstown \u2013 that are being served by new hyperlocal news and information organizations. These startups were among the recipients of the first round of public funding from the New Jersey Civic Information Consortium, a first-of-its-kind state-level public funding mechanism for news and information initiatives throughout the state.\n\nThe needs of the audiences for the three outlets were both universal and specific to their communities. People need reliable, timely, fact-based information about their communities in order to live their lives and participate in society. At the same time, certain communities have needs specific to their location, context, and history. \n\nPaterson (Paterson Info Hub)\n\nPaterson, N.J., is a majority-Hispanic city (61 percent of the population, in the latest census). Within that Hispanic community, most people are from the Dominican Republic, although nearly every Central and South American country is represented, meaning Spanish is widely spoken. Paterson also has a sizable Arabic community. With nearly 160,000 residents, Paterson is one of New Jersey\u2019s largest cities; however its median household income is below average for the state, at $45,141. Detailed demographic info for Paterson may be found in Appendix A.\n\nPaterson is served by a robust array of nonprofit and local government organizations, including the organization involved in this project, The Paterson Alliance. The Paterson Alliance is a 501(c)3 founded in 1998 to bring these various agents together to \u201cimprove collaboration between members, to be inclusive and build a culture where everyone feels respected, included, and valued.\u201d The Paterson Alliance represents more than 80 nonprofits in the city, and through its various activities around education, housing, food security, and other areas, it touches many families throughout the community. \n\nAlthough Paterson currently has a handful of local news outlets, (e.g. Perselay Associates and Janus Solutions, 2020; Stonbely, 2021) the bulk of the content consists of crime coverage and re-purposed press releases from local businesses. In particular, there is very little to no coverage of the activities of the nonprofits in the Alliance or the communities they serve, the issues they deal with, or the services available to them. \n\nThe Paterson Information Hub (\u201cInfo Hub\u201d) is a new initiative by the Alliance to provide that missing critical information to the Paterson community, beginning with a shared calendar and later also providing original journalism. The Info Hub is a partnership between Paterson Alliance and Paterson Free Public Library, which has provided resources and community connections to the effort. \n\nTo gather the data that informed the Paterson information needs assessment, the Center for Cooperative Media conducted an online survey as well as in-person focus groups. The number of respondents for the online survey was 67; three focus groups \u2013 one in Spanish and two in English -- were hosted at the Paterson Free Public Library. The first English focus group had 3 participants, the second had 10, and the Spanish focus group had 9 participants.\n\nTrenton (Trenton Journal)\n\nTrenton is New Jersey\u2019s state capital and one of its largest and best-known cities. Nearly half of its population identified in the most recent census as Black/African American, and it has a sizable Hispanic and Latinx population as well. One of the defining geographic features of Trenton is its \u201cwards,\u201d which are named according to their cardinal location (north, south, etc.). According to Miles the North ward is known to be the wealthiest, and has many historical buildings. The South ward, by contrast, is the least affluent. The West ward is the most suburban of the four, and the East ward is home to the high school and many of the clusters of immigrants that make up Trenton\u2019s population. Detailed demographic info for Trenton may be found in Appendix A.\n\nTrenton\u2019s media market is similar to those of many cities in the sense that what used to be a relatively thriving ecosystem is now home to papers that have had their staffs and budgets cut repeatedly over the years and a handful of digital-native startups who have much smaller staffs and budgets than their legacy ancestors (e.g. Peterson\u2019s Breaking News of Trenton). For example, in September 2022 Isaac Avilucea left The Trentonian after covering Trenton for 8 years, leaving the outlet without any full-time reporters, and leaving the state capital with very little if any watchdog coverage. Kenneth Miles started The Trenton Journal in 2021 to address some of these gaps; his goal is to produce positive stories for the Black and Brown communities in the area, focusing specifically on culture and local politics.\n\nTrenton Journal is different from the two other outlets in this study because it had been active for more than a year at the time of the research. Miles is the main producer of content for the site and runs it in addition to working a separate full-time job. He was very enthusiastic about conducting an information needs assessment to have a better idea of who would be interested in the local news he produces and what they need that he doesn\u2019t currently offer. \n\nTo gather the data that informs the Trenton information needs assessment, we conducted an online survey as well as in-person focus groups. The number of respondents for the online survey was 119; the two English-language focus groups were held at the Trenton Free Public Library and Ujima Village, which is a community organization. One focus group had 10 participants and one had seven.", "input": ""}

It is a condition that adversely affects an individual's functional abilities and level of independence by causing chronic impairment and is particularly prevalent in adults and the elderly. Based on Foo (as cited in the Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2010), the prevalence of KOA in Malaysia is estimated to be between 10% to 20% of the elderly population. The growing number of old or natural ageing, and higher body mass index (BMI), are the key factors contributing to KOA, as claimed by Wallace et al. (2017) However, it is common for adults and the elderly to develop knee discomfort or KOA as the cartilage that was supposed to act as a shock absorber for mechanical body weight-bearing movements gradually deteriorates. As a result, KOA can cause chronic progressive pain and disturb the patient\u2019s functional ability. The loss of workforce and other psychological implications can affect a patient's professional life, entertainment, social life, and sleep pattern and significantly reduce the quality of life (QoL) of KOA patients (Askin et al., 2017). This study\u2019s primary concern is to examine the use of manual therapy and exercise therapy in managing the symptoms of KOA, with the primary goal of improving functional ability. Typically, patients with KOA opt for medicine to alleviate pain, oblivious that an active lifestyle is equally required to manage the symptoms of KOA. Pharmaceutical therapies alone will not help patients with KOA improve their functional ability. Therefore, pharmacological therapies should be omitted in this systematic review study. This systematic review study will include all publications and journals describing the effects of manual treatment and exercise therapy on improving the functional ability of KOA patients. This study will then systematically review the medical literature that studied the critical role of manual therapy and exercise therapy as interventions to enhance functional ability and improve QoL. It is necessary to continue this study as the elderly population has a higher risk of developing KOA which cannot be avoided in the natural ageing process that will happen to everyone. Furthermore, Shamsi et al. (2021) studied that age-related diseases such as osteoarthritis will be significantly accelerated in emerging countries and will remain increase in the future, particularly in Asian countries.\n\n1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT\n\nThe world-increasing trend of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total knee replacement, as claimed by Gao et al. (2020), is worrying. In the future, it is possible as KOA can be popular among adults as early as 30 years old. Most people would want surgical interventions immediately without opting for conservative treatments due to time constraints and non-adherence to exercises. Furthermore, in the early stage of KOA, surgery should not be an option; however, most patients with KOA would still not adhere to the manual therapy and exercise therapy that has been prescribed. Manual therapy and exercise therapy during that stage should greatly help manage KOA symptoms and prevent rapid deterioration, progressing KOA quicker to the severe stage. Even in the later stage, manual therapy and exercise therapy shall be part of the treatment options while seeking surgical interventions.\n\n1.3 PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThis systematic review study aims to disclose the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy in improving KOA patients' pain and functional ability. The effectiveness of manual and exercise therapy can be measured using reliable outcome measures of pain and functional ability. A helpful guideline and assistance in advocating for the public to opt for manual therapy and exercise therapy to manage KOA symptoms will be a great success once the efficacy of these treatments has been\nproven.\n\n1.4 RESEARCH OBJECTIVE(S)\n\nGeneral Objectives:\nTo systematically review the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy in reducing pain and improving the functional ability of patients with KOA\n\nSpecific Objectives:\nTo systematically review the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy from the published research works in managing pain symptoms of KOA patients.\nTo systematically review the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy from the published research works in enhancing the functional ability of KOA patients.\n\n1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION(S)\n\nDoes manual therapy and exercise therapy effectively reduce the pain symptoms of patients with KOA?\nDoes manual therapy and exercise therapy effectively improve the functional ability of patients with KOA?\n\n1.6 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS\n\nManual therapy and exercise therapy will reduce pain symptoms for KOA patients.\nManual therapy and exercise therapy will improve the functional ability of KOA patients.\n\n1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nSuppose this study aims to prove manual and exercise therapy's efficacy. In that case, it will be able to make a guideline for health professionals and the public, especially for individuals with KOA. Moreover, a solid guideline can advocate for the public and raise awareness of the conservative treatments they may seek to control the KOA symptoms, especially those in the early stage, and could prevent arthroplasty or joint replacement. Naturally, the human with pain perception will avoid moving; however, it is possible to move the body while in pain with the proper technique. Besides that, manual therapy is also there to help individuals with KOA reduce pain through the hands of health professionals. This study is not solely for individuals with KOA but is also great for those who aim to slow down the natural-ageing degeneration process, which leads to KOA.\n\n1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\n1.8.1 Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA)\n\nKnee osteoarthritis is a degenerative disorder of articular cartilage. It includes the pathology of wide tissues such as the meniscus, synovial membrane, and subchondral bone constituting the knee joint, ligament, joint capsule, tendon, and muscle (Kanamoto et al., 2020).\n\n1.8.2 Manual Therapy\n\nManual therapy is an advanced speciality area of physical therapy based on manual examination and treatment techniques integrated with exercise, patient education, and other physical therapy modalities to address pain, loss of function, and wellness. American Academy of Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapists (AAOMPT) Description of Advanced Specialty Practice (DASP) (2018) as cited from Physiopedia.\n\n1.8.3 Exercise Therapy\n\nExercise therapy consists of movements and physical activities that increase strength and function and reduce discomfort. (Australian Sports Physiotherapy, 2021)\n\n1.9 CHAPTER SUMMARY\n\nThe chapter started with a background study on KOA and manual therapy and exercise therapy as part of interventions done to improve individuals\u2019 functional ability and continued with problem statements and the purpose of the study. Afterwards, this chapter presents the research objectives, questions, and hypothesis, guiding this systematic review study in assessing related articles and providing relevant and solid studies concerning the research's objectives, questions, and hypothesis. It then proceeded with the significance of the study to emphasise why it should be done and, lastly, explain the terms that are primarily used in this research.", "input": ""}

My only complaint is that the neck hole is a little small & it\u2019s really hard to pull off at the end of the day. My kids are top of the charts for head circumference, so I get it.

Perfect weight perfect fit all good. My problem is that I needed two of them. I have a 10 year old boy and an eight year old girl who are nearly the same size. I almost ordered two of another product, labeled for girls, because it didn\u2019t look like it could be specifically for girls but I really didn\u2019t want to risk making my son wear a \u201cgirly\u201d hoodie so I looked for one that was for boys. I found this one and paid seven dollars more than the other because it said for boys. When they arrived the absolute only difference is that inside the hood around the neck the \u201cboys\u201d hoodie has blue stitching. I won\u2019t return this one because it was only seven dollars more, but it kind of irritated me that the other was labeled for girls when there\u2019s nothing different about the two, except the cost.\nOne person found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport abuse\n Dee Harb\n5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect basic hoodie\nReviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on March 9, 2023\nSize: LargeColor: WhiteVerified Purchase\nPurchased this hoodie in a size large for my 70lb, 55inch tall and slim 10 year old. It fit him perfectly but it will not fit him next year. He loves how soft and warm the fabric is, and has said it is his favorite hoodie. The white is a pure white and does get easily dirty, but nothing that a tide stick can\u2019t handle.\nHelpful\nIs this a true gender neutral product, or is it only for one of the genders?

{"category": "default", "instruction": "Hi Eddy,\n\nEnclosed is the Membership Subscriptions proposal that we shared with Phil on Friday, 6/1. We believe Membership Subscriptions will become a sizable new revenue stream but if we don\u2019t move quickly to set the precedent, our window of opportunity to capture it will close. Lyft and Uber are two notable developers which are planning to launch subscriptions in their app soon. Phil confirmed that these memberships should be considered a new sub-category for subscriptions. He also agreed that apps which offer these types of memberships, should be using IAP. As a next step, we are working with App Review/Legal to formalize our policy on Membership Subscriptions.\n\nSummary of presentation:\n\nThere is a rising trend of traditionally physical goods and services developers selling subscriptions that provide access to various benefits (e.g. unlimited free deliveries, discounts, unique access, etc). Amazon Prime is a classic example of this and was recently approved for IAP.\nMultiple apps have launched or are planning to launch memberships programs, where the purchase of the membership is de-coupled from the purchase of the actual product or service. Uber and Lyft are currently testing various subscription models (e.g. Pay $10/month to lock in a flat rate from home to work and 10% off all other rides; Pay $400 upfront for unlimited rides, etc). Lyft has told us they will pursue a full-scale launch as early as next month.\nWe introduced a framework for how to think about monetization on the App Store in it\u2019s current state\u2026and how it might look like in the future (page 2&3). We believe Membership Subscriptions can become a key lever to monetize some of the most popular free apps.\nIn addition to the apps that currently have membership subscriptions (e.g. Postmates, Costco, and Instacart) there are many additional apps that could benefit from a membership subscription (e.g. Nordstrom, Alibaba, Ticketmaster, etc). Our team would like to proactively pitch these partners to offer membership subscriptions and to discuss the benefits of IAP, once our policy is official.\nMany of these developers recognize the benefits of using our subscriptions platform, particularly as a way to launch and operationalize these memberships quickly. However, we anticipate our 30% commission will be a key concern for them.\nPlease reach out with any questions and we\u2019d be happy to discuss live.\n\nThanks,\n\nSheree and Lindsey", "input": ""}

It merely works with the material of experience, education, and observation with which it is fed.\nIt is the faculty used most by the inventor, with the exception of the who draws upon the creative imagination, when he cannot solve his problem through synthetic imagination.\nCreative Imagination\nThrough the faculty of creative imagination, the finite mind of man has direct communication with Infinite Intelligence.\nIt is the faculty through which \u201chunches\u201d and \u201cinspirations\u201d are received. Through this skill all basic, or new ideas are handed over to man.\nIt is through this faculty that thought vibrations from the minds of others are received. Through this power one individual may \u201ctune in,\u201d or communicate with the subconscious minds of other men.\nThe creative imagination works automatically. This faculty functions ONLY when the conscious mind is vibrating at an exceedingly rapid rate, as for example, when the conscious mind is stimulated through the emotion of a strong desire.\nThe creative faculty becomes more alert, more receptive to vibrations from the sources mentioned, in proportion to its development through USE. This statement is significant! Ponder over it before passing on.\nThe great leaders of business, industry, finance, and the great artists, musicians, poets, and writers became great, because they developed the faculty of creative imagination.\nBoth the synthetic and creative faculties of imagination become more alert with use, just as any muscle or organ of the body develops through use.\nDesire is only a thought, an impulse. It is nebulous and ephemeral. It is abstract, and of no value, until it has been transformed into its physical counterpart.\nCreative visualization, manifesting, and the law of attraction use the imagination to create success.", "input": ""}

{"category": "default", "instruction": "Career Exploration Report \n\\*\\*Due Date: Week 7, Wed 29 Mar, 4 pm\\*\\*\n\n[Career Fit Analysis Draft](https://www.notion.so/Career-Fit-Analysis-Draft-319f354ad3e844dca00e50b5b9d2cd85)\n\nPurpose:\n\nThis exercise provides you with an opportunity to systematically investigate two careers and/or jobs you are interested in pursuing, as well as to network with two people who are in your chosen careers and/or jobs.\n\nOverview:\n\nYou will conduct research on two careers/jobs. The research will entail networking with and interviewing a suitable person in each career. In conducting this research, you will obtain a broad understanding of these careers/jobs, validate or invalidate the assumptions and uncertainties you hold concerning these careers/jobs, and explore other questions that you may have concerning those careers. You will then write a report analyzing your networking experience and what you have learned about the two careers/jobs. You will also describe the next steps in your career planning and the lessons learned in light of this analysis.\n\nRequired Format:\n\n\\*\\*Step 1: Identify two career(s) and/or job(s) you are currently interested in pursuing (approx. 150 words)\\*\\*\n\nA student might be interested in two career areas: human resources and marketing. Another might be interested in one job (e.g., advertising manager) within the marketing major and one career (e.g., entrepreneur). Obviously, some careers and jobs may seem more viable to you than do others, but it is important to provide a comparison of two careers/jobs.\n\nDrawing on academic sources (from Week 1 readings and lecture), define career and job. Based on these definitions, explain \\*\\*\\*whether and how\\*\\*\\* the chosen careers or jobs represent careers or jobs TO YOU.\n\n\\*\\*Step 2: Identify assumptions/beliefs and uncertainties (in Appendix)\\*\\*\n\nFor each of the careers or jobs, identify the following:\n\n1. Two positive assumptions/beliefs you have concerning the career/job.\n2. Two negative assumptions/beliefs you have concerning the career/job.\n3. Two uncertainties you have concerning the career/job.\n\nIn deciding which careers/jobs to pursue, you will have made implicit assumptions about your future compensation, the nature of your work, type of job difficulties, and forms of satisfaction and dissatisfaction in this future career. Some of these assumptions and beliefs will be true, whereas others will be false. Nevertheless, it is important for you to validate your assumptions and beliefs as you pursue your studies and before you seek employment.\n\nList the assumptions/beliefs and uncertainties for each career/job that are most important to you in the form of statements in an Appendix. Clearly label each - a) positive or b) negative assumption or c) an uncertainty.\n\n\\*\\*Step 3: Translate assumptions/beliefs and uncertainties into questions for each career/job (in Appendix)\\*\\*Translate the assumptions/beliefs and uncertainties you have identified in Step 2 into a series of questions to be asked of your interviewees. The reader should be able to \\*easily identify\\* which question is written for which assumption and uncertainty (a table format may help).\n\nHow? To translate your assumption that one needs a Bachelor\u2019s degree for a job into a question, you might ask what educational background is needed to get this job. Or, you assume that this career requires a significant time commitment and thus you believe that you will not achieve a work-life balance. Your questions might then be: What is the average number of hours you work in a typical week? How has this career impacted you and your family and your work-life balance? How are you managing your work-life balance? Or, you have a positive assumption that this career provides you with lots of travel opportunities. Your question might entail: To what extent are there national and international travel opportunities in this career? What do those opportunities usually entail \u2013 attending meetings and trade shows, running workshops, etc?\n\n\\*\\*Step 4: Choose and contact at least one person to interview, analyze and reflect on the networking process and describe one lesson learned from this \\*networking experience\\* (approx. 300 words)\\*\\*\n\nIdentify and contact the people you wish to interview. The choice of who to interview is extremely important. It is best for you to identify the type of individual who would best answer your questions instead of contacting someone who is merely the most convenient. Use some of the criteria presented in Week 1 as a guide when you are identifying interviewees. Remember, professionalism begins with your initial contact. Do not interview by SMS or email. These interviews should be conducted face-to-face (or virtually with webcams on, if impossible to arrange).\n\nOnce the relevant criteria are chosen, identify who matches those criteria. Sources of contacts include alumni, friends, parents of other students, members of professional organizations, those you meet in networking events, etc. See Week 1 tutorial slides for more suggestions.\n\nFollow the contact tips in Week 1 slides,\n\nIn the Report:\n\na) State who you interviewed. The interviewees can remain anonymous if they wish, but please provide their job titles and type of companies (e.g., size, location) in which they work. State whether it was conducted face-to-face (or virtually - explain why a face-to-face meeting was not possible)\n\nb) Analyse and reflect on this networking experience. Draw on \\*at least 1 concept from the course\\* (with proper citation of course reading(s) and lecture/tutorial material(s)) when analyzing this \\*process\\*. The application of course concept(s) to this experience should help you answer the questions of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and thus deepen your reflection.\n\nc) Describe one lesson you have learned about networking in light of your analysis and reflection on this networking experience.\n\n\\*\\*Step 5: Summarize and reflect on the findings. (approx. 700 words)\\*\\*\n\nDiscuss the following:\n\na) How have your research and interview findings validated or invalidated your assumptions/beliefs and uncertainties about these careers/jobs? Summarize one or two findings for each career that are most important or surprising to you.\n\nb) Have your career plans been adjusted as a result of this exercise? If so, how? If not, why not? Be sure to describe your specific plan moving forward and explain why your plan is a reasonable and/or effective one based on your findings. The plan should include activities related to personal development, specific career/job search strategies, etc. Draw on \\*at least 1 concept from the course\\* (with proper citation of the academic source) for a and/or b to analyze and deepen your understanding of the findings and/or explain how they impact you and your career plan. Again, this application of course concept(s) to your findings/plan should help you answer the questions of \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d and thus deepen your reflection. This analysis should then lead you to reflect on a specific lesson learned about your career/job (i.e., c below).\n\nc) Describe the most important lesson you have learned about the careers/jobs in light of your analysis and reflection on your interview findings.\n\n\\*\\*Include Reference list and Appendices\\*\\*\n\nYou must cite all work properly throughout your report in [Harvard style](https://student.unsw.edu.au/referencing) and provide a reference list. You do not need to cite references \\*not\\* covered in the course. You must also include a list of assumptions/beliefs and uncertainties, as well as the associated interview questions in the Appendix.\n\nYou may use standard editing and referencing software (e.g., Microsoft Office suite, Grammarly, etc.), but \\*\\*\\*not\\* generative AI\\*\\*.\n\nReview resources on [how to write a reflective report](https://student.unsw.edu.au/reflective-writing).\n\n\\*\\*Note: All contents will be treated in strict confidence and with great respect.\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*MARKING CRITERIA FOR CAREER EXPLORATION REPORT\\*\\*\n\n| Key Criteria | Grade |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1) Step 1\n\u2022 Identify two career(s) and/or job(s).\n\u2022 Career and job are defined in an accurate and scholarly manner.\n\u2022 Drawing on their academic definitions from the course, explain whether and how the chosen career(s) and/or job(s) represent career(s) or job(s) to you. | /2 |\n| 2) Step 2\n\u2022 Two positive assumptions/beliefs, two negative assumptions/beliefs and two uncertainties about each preferred career and/or job are listed in an Appendix. | /3 |\n| 3) Steps 3a and 3b\n\u2022 Questions, phrased in a professional manner, are accurately translated in a way that solicits responses that validate or invalidate each assumption/belief and uncertainty.

Having multiple perspectives will give insight into how well a resource will be received. The team should be trained on how to find alignment between resources and standards. The team should be calibrated around the schools mission, vision, and the standards that must be addressed. \n3) Currently my district does not have much collaboration between content experts and IT when it comes to the selection and review process. It is something that is needed as technology continues to play a crucial role in education. \n4) Our current instructional review process does not take MTSS, PBIS or RTI into account.

Quickly add a language/tool/CLI to a development container.* |\n\n'Features' are self-contained units of installation code and development container configuration. Features are designed\nto install atop a wide-range of base container images.\n\nMissing a CLI or language in your otherwise \\_perfect\\_ container image? Add the relevant Feature to the `features`\nproperty of a [`devcontainer.json`](https://containers.dev/implementors/json\\_reference/#general-properties). A\n[tool supporting the dev container specification](https://containers.dev/supporting) is required to build a development\ncontainer.\n\nYou may learn about Features at [containers.dev](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/), which is the website for the dev container specification.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo reference a Feature from this repository, add the desired Features to a `devcontainer.json`.

{"category": "functional_writing", "instruction": "Based on the following article, please present me with a few possible arugments that may be used for an argumentative essay. :Can You Buy Happiness?\nResearch\nAccess to basic needs\nHow you spend matters\nHow much do you need?\nHow to increase happiness\nTakeaway\nDoes money buy happiness? Maybe, but it\u2019s not a simple question to answer. There are many studies on the topic and many factors that come into play, such as:\n\ncultural values\nwhere you live\nwhat matters to you\nhow you spend your money\nSome even argue that the amount of money matters, and that you may not feel additional happiness after amassing a certain amount of wealth.\n\nKeep reading to learn what the research says about the connection between money and happiness.\n\nWhat\u2019s the connection between money and happiness?\nThings that bring you happiness can be said to have intrinsic value. This means they\u2019re valuable to you but don\u2019t necessarily represent a standard value for happiness to others.\n\nMoney, on the other hand, has extrinsic value. This means that others recognize money has real-world value, too, and will (generally) accept it.\n\nFor example, you may find pleasure in the smell of lavender, but someone else might find it less appealing. Each of you assigns a different intrinsic value to the scent of lavender.\n\nYou can\u2019t literally buy happiness at a store. But when money is used in certain ways, such as purchasing things that bring you happiness, you can use it to add intrinsic value to your life.\n\nSo, if the smell of lavender brings you joy, you could use money to buy it in various forms and keep it around your home or office. That, in turn, may increase your happiness. In this example, you\u2019re using money to indirectly bring you happiness.\n\nThis can apply to numerous situations. But, while the things you buy may bring short-term happiness, they may not always lead to long-term or lasting happiness.\n\nHere are some further arguments for and against money buying happiness.\n\nMoney may increase happiness and health for people affected by poverty\nA 2018 studyTrusted Source looked at what would happen over time if women in poverty-stricken households in Zambia were given regular cash transfers with no strings attached.\n\nThe most notable finding was that, over a 48-month period, many women had a much higher sense of emotional well-being and satisfaction about their health, for both themselves and their children.\n\nA 2010 study based on a Gallup poll of more than 450,000 respondents suggests that making an income up to $75,000 a year may make you feel more satisfied with your life. This survey only looked at people in the United States.\n\nAnother Gallup poll from 2017Trusted Source surveyed people from around the world and resulted in similar findings. According to survey results, emotional well-being may be reached when a person earns between $60,000 and $75,000. Satiation may occur when a person earns around $95,000.\n\nCulture may affect this threshold. Depending on your culture, you may find happiness in different things than someone with different cultural values.\n\nThese studies and surveys suggest that money may help buy happiness when used to meet basic needs.\n\nAccess to healthcare, nutritious foods, and a home where you feel safe can improve mental and physical health and may, in some cases, lead to increased happiness.\n\nOnce basic needs are met, however, the happiness a person can gain from money may grow stagnantTrusted Source.\n\nDoes how you spend money matter?\nYes! This is the heart of the debate.\n\nBuying \u201cexperiences\u201d and helping others can lead to happiness. And there\u2019s some actual research behind this.\n\nResults from a survey of researchTrusted Source on this topic suggest that spending money on experiences rather than tangible goods and giving to others with no thought of reward results in the greatest feelings of happiness.\n\nThis could take the form of going to a concert instead of buying a new TV, or buying someone you love a thoughtful gift rather than indulging yourself in an impulse buy.\n\nAnd here\u2019s another thing to think about: An extensive 2015 survey of literature about emotions and decision making found that your subjective judgement of the value of something has a lot to do with how you feel about the outcome. The authors called this the appraisal-tendency framework (ATF).\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re afraid of your house being broken into, buying a state-of-the-art home security system may reduce your level of fear, which can then improve your happiness or emotional well-being.\n\nIn this case, your happiness is linked to your subjective experience of fear.\n\nIs there a magic number?\nYes and no. Believe it or not, some research has been done on this.\n\nA 2010 study by noted economist and psychologist Daniel Kahneman found that, where wealth is concerned, a person\u2019s satisfaction with their life no longer increases after about $75,000 a year.\n\nAt this point, most people are better able to handle major life stressors like poor health, relationships, or loneliness than if they\u2019re making less or are below the poverty line.\n\nBeyond that, daily habits and lifestyle are the main drivers of happiness.\n\nResults from a more recent study that looked at happiness in European populations points to a much lower dollar amount being equated to happiness: 27,913 euros a year.\n\nThat\u2019s equivalent (at the time of the study) to about $35,000 a year. That\u2019s half of the American figure.\n\nThis may have to do with relative costs of living in the United States compared to Europe. Healthcare and higher education are often less expensive in Europe than in the United States.\n\nThe researchers also mention several other cultural factors that may contribute to the lower correlation of money to happiness in these countries.\n\nOther ways to increase happiness\nMoney may not buy happiness, but there are some things you can do to try to increase happiness. Consider the following:\n\nWrite down what you\u2019re grateful for. Literally \u201ccounting your blessingsTrusted Source\u201d can help you feel more positive. Instead of thinking about what you don\u2019t have, think about the things you do have.\nMeditate. Clear your mind and focus on your inner self rather than your possessions. Focus on who you are versus what you own.\nExercise. Exercise can help increase endorphins, which can lead to short-term happiness. Exercise may also help you feel more confident or comfortable in your own skin.\nTakeaway\nMoney is unlikely to buy happiness, but it may help you achieve happiness to an extent. Look for purchases that will help you feel fulfilled.\n\nAnd beyond that, you can find happiness through other nonfinancial means, like spending time with people you enjoy or thinking about the good things in your life.\n\nLast medically reviewed on October 29, 2019\n\nHow we reviewed this article:\n\nSOURCES\n\nHISTORY\nOur experts continually monitor the health and wellness space, and we update our articles when new information becomes available.\n\nCurrent Version\n\nOct 29, 2019\n\nWritten By\n\nTim Jewell\n\nEdited By\n\nJudy Lee\n\nMedically Reviewed By\n\nTimothy J.

Hazut Lev whose goal is to operate a nursing home\nThere is a cash flow crisis in the company Nahum claims that he knows non-banking entities that will help us, and because our crisis is temporary,\nNahum's offer has no funding sources and no choice but to accept the offer, we will only pay an interest rate of 1% per month and we can repay immediately\nHe transferred two loans to the company\n1. \\* 23.9.17 300 thousand from Amit Biran,\n\\* 5.8.18 from Guy Mirom 180 thousand NIS\n In addition to these loans, Nahum extended other loans even when it was not necessary and we could raise from the bank at a more favorable interest rate. Nahum's goal is to earn both as a shareholder, and also open another lending business\nIt should be noted that the mediation agreement was signed when we did not know that the non-bank lenders were in fact Nahum Van and not a priority compared to the banks, otherwise we would pay the banks and not him as a lower priority than the bank loans\n The loan we received on August 5, 2018 is a loan of only 150 and he registered 180,000. His claim is that he transferred another 30,000 from the loan agreements\n In addition to this, Nahum made additional loans to the company Mtsav in the excel report (this excel is every movement in cash that entered and left the company from 2018-today) and based on this I base my position on the reason that they lie and cheat in the reports)\n We did not receive invoices for all these loans and there were no loan agreements from the Central Bank\nAccording to my reports and documents that Jacob gave me, the picture is like this\n2.

Another short-term loan to the company in the amount of NIS 1.257 million without invoices and receipts\n5.

We will send all voice messages to the customer for approval prior to completion.\nOnce the recording completed and available for implementation, account for a minimum of 2 weeks to get the custom voice messages implemented into our system. Custom messages are deployed and released during our normal sprint cycles.\nOnce the message has been implemented into the TeleSign infrastructure, it is assigned a custom tag (the Development team will assign the tag). The custom tag is assigned after the recording has been added to the TeleSign database.\nThe CSM will then provide the customer with the custom tag created for this recording with instructions on how to integrate the tag into the API call.\nThe customer needs to pass this custom tag generated by TeleSign in the  parameter that would call this custom voice message to be played on their transactions.\n\\*On average, it may take between 4-8 week in total to record, QA, approve and implement. We\u2019ve seen it take longer when the customer tries to do it themselves. Please note that if the customer provides their own recording, it still has to pass our internal QA testing.\nVoice Recording requirements (to provide to the customer if they choose to record on their own)\nDesired Format: wav file, 16 bit, 44.1kHz, mono\nLength: less than 28 seconds including the code\nThe customer will need to record digits 0-9 with at least 2 second pauses in between each digit. They should ideally record the digits separately or can also put them all in one file \u2013 our system can slice as needed.\nSample language for custom voice message is shown below.\nhttps://confluence.telesign.com/display/cs/2FA+Custom+Messages\nNote that our system is designed to pull the verification code into the recording in the following format: Greeting, code, repeat code, goodbye. If a client has recorded their own custom message with the pause break for the [code] in the middle of the Greeting, it will need to be re-recorded to have the pause break for the [code] at the end of the Greeting.\n\u201cHello. Thank you for using [Company name]\u2019s phone verification system. Your code is [code]. Once again, your code is [code]. Good-bye from [Company name].\u201d\n 5. Fee to implement custom voice messages: $250/message.\n 6. Fee for TeleSign to record a custom voice message for client starts at $530, which includes the implementation fee above\nThis fee varies by language. See the custom voice pricing chart in the shared drive for fees T:\\Sales\\Client Services\\Custom Voice Recordings\\Custom Voice Message Pricing.xl\nThe fee of $530 applies to English and other common languages, such as German, Italian, Spanish, Korean, Vietnamese, etc. However, the fee is higher ($670) for languages such as Azerbaijani, Bengali, Igbo, Macedonian, etc.", "input": ""}

Start with creating new unit groups by defining the unique combination of unit groups that you want to offer to your guests.\n\n- Choose your property in the context selector, and navigate to Inventory > Unit Groups.\n\n- Create a new unit group (refer Create Unit Groups for more help) by filling in all the necessary details and choosing the option \"connecting unit group\". And then mention its composition details.\n\nFor example, you can create a family suite unit group, by specifying that it\u2019s a combination of 1 Double unit and 1 Single unit.\n\nmceclip0.png\n\nNote: Once a unit group is created as a connecting unit group, its composition details can't be modified later on.\n2. Create new connecting units by specifying which of the combination of the units is forming this new connecting unit.\n\n- Go to Inventory > Units, and click on New units (refer Create units for more help). \n\nmceclip1.png\n\n \n\nFor example, the unit FS1 is created as a combined unit of 1.001 (double) and 1.003 (single) units.\n\nmceclip0.png\n\n \n\nNote: Once a unit is created as a connecting unit, its composition details can't be modified later on. \n\n \n\nYou can see the dependency of the connecting units clearly on the room rack.\n\nmceclip2.png\n\n \n\n3. Repeat steps 1. and 2. for all your combined inventory.\n\n4. Now you can sell your units either individually or offer them as a combined unit.\n\n- Create rate plans (Setup rate plans) for the connecting unit groups and offer them to your guests as you do for any regular inventory type.\n\n \n\nSelling units individually or as combined units\nIf one of the interconnected units is sold individually to a reservation, the combined unit would become unsellable and it would also be reflected accordingly on your room rack and availability sections.\nAvailability screen:\n\nmceclip7.png\n\n \n\nOn room rack:\n\nmceclip3.png\n\nYou can receive a regular reservation or a group booking on a connecting unit group and we would deduct the availability on all related unit groups automatically based on the composition of the connecting unit group. Also, whenever a combined unit is assigned to a reservation, it automatically deducts the availability of underlying interconnected units for that timeline.\nmceclip4.png\n\n \n\nMaintenances on the units\nAny maintenance on the inter-connected units would impact the combined unit's availability. But doesn't impact the other connected units. \nFor example, if 1.001 is Out of Order, it would also impact the unit FS1 for that timeline.\n\nmceclip5.png\n\nIt is also possible to create maintenance on the combined units. However, any maintenance on the combined unit would be independent and do not impact the underlying interconnected units. The units can still be sold individually when you decide not to sell the combined unit anymore for whatever reasons.\nmceclip6.png\n\n \n\nHow would the Occupancy, Guest Flow, and Revenue KPIs look like when selling Combined Inventory?\nCombined inventory count is always excluded from your House count. And thus, by default also does not impact your occupancy KPIs.\nGuest Flow would always represent the information based on the reservations.\nFor example, when a booking is made for a Family suite that consists of 1 single and 1 double, we increase the sold count of single and double unit groups automatically. And thus, for your overall property, arrivals would be 1, and sold unit count would be 2.\nWhenever a combined unit group is sold, the revenue would always be marked on the connecting unit group though indirectly you sold a set of different unit groups through it. From the above example, if the Family suite is sold for 100 EUR, then on your property overview you will see that 1 guest arriving for the family suite, and you have sold 2 units (1 single and 1 double) and the revenue generated is 100 EUR.\n\nThese details can be viewed on your General Manager Report. \n\n \n\n[REQUIREMENTS]: under 2 minutes\n[REQUEST]: Generate a comprehensive and usable [TASK TYPE] for a [MEDIUM] that is appropriate for [AUDIENCE], is based on [BACKGROUND], and [REQUIREMENTS]", "input": ""}

There are so many dogs in animal shelters all over the world looking for their forever homes, including both puppies and older dogs. These adorable dogs may have come to a rescue centre because they've had a rough start to life or their previous owners may no longer have been able to care for them. One thing's for sure though, rescue dogs just need someone who can offer them plenty of love and understanding. If you think you could offer a rescue dog or puppy a warm and happy home, keep reading and we'll answer all your questions, including how to adopt a dog and where to find a rescue centre. Adopting a dog Giving a rescue dog a happy new home can be a rewarding experience for you and a transformation for dog that's waiting for a second chance, but there's a lot to consider and prepare for when adopting a rescue dog. Should I adopt a dog or a puppy? Adopting a dog or puppy from a rescue centre can be an incredibly rewarding experience. Not only will you be supporting the work of a worthwhile charity, but you'll also be giving an unwanted pup a second chance. If you're thinking about adopting a dog, you'll need to decide whether you have time for a bouncy puppy or want to get a calmer, older dog instead. Puppies will demand a lot of devotion such as training, cleaning up, disciplining and will require plenty of attention to give them everything they need. Because of this, it's not a good idea to consider a puppy if you work long hours or if there won't be someone around during the day to care for them. On the other hand, if you adopt an older dog, they will already have an established routine, a degree of training and will generally just be more responsible. Finding a friend for life If you're unsure what kind of dog best suits your lifestyle, home and family, your local dog adoption centre can help with that. When you express an interest in rescuing a dog or puppy, the dog rescue will usually give you a questionnaire to fill out to better understand your current circumstances, then they'll be able to recommend a suitable dog for you. They're well versed in finding good matches for both people and pets, so you can rest assured that they can help in finding you a friend for life. Additionally, leading charities can offer you lifelong support, so if you ever have issues with your dog, most rescue centres will be willing to help. If your circumstances ever change, most will welcome their dogs back again too. Things to consider when adopting a dog: Making the decision to get a new dog is always exciting, but there are many considerations you should also take into account. In some sad circumstances, dogs end up in rehoming centres because of neglect or maltreatment. Some may come with a bit of baggage, but staff will always be honest about a dog's needs: be sure you can handle the commitment if you're adopting a dog with a hard history. If you live in rented accommodation, be sure to check with your landlord that you can have a dog at the property beforehand. If you already have dogs, introducing a rescue animal should be done with care. If a dog has been used for breeding or showing, they may have learned certain behaviours that you'll have to help them adapt. It can take time and effort to settle a rescue dog into your home and build a bond, so be patient. Dogs need plenty of space inside and out. Ensure you have enough room in your living arrangements before rescuing a dog. You'll also need enough space in your schedule. Dogs require daily walks and interaction: be sure you have enough time to dedicate to their behavioural, social, and physical needs. There are cost implications of adopting a dog; as well as adoption fees, which vary among rehoming centres, you also need to think about the long-term cost implications of having a puppy. Account for pet insurance, potential vet bills and routine treatments, food, grooming, accessories, toys and kennel bills for when you're on holiday. Dog Breeds: At adoption centres, there's a huge variety of dog breeds available, from West Highland Terriers to Husky's, you never know what you're going to get! There does tend to be a lot of more mixed breeds. However, just because a pup doesn't have a pure bloodline, doesn't make them any less of a worthy companion! How to adopt a dog When considering how to adopt a dog, the first thing you need to do is to find a dog adoption centre, there are hundreds of options which can be found online or locally. It's a good idea to find one that's relatively local to you as some centres will require you to go for multiple visits to ensure that you're a good match with your chosen pup. Once you've found your perfect puppy, you'll need to complete an application form which will include information about you, your family and your living circumstances, this will help for them to assess if the dog will match you. After this, you can expect a phone call or email from the adoption centre where they'll set up an appointment for you to finally meet your potential pup. Once you get there, you'll be able to meet and interact with them and usually, you'll also be able to visit and interact with a variety of other dogs to ensure that your choice is the right one. One thing to be aware of is that some centres like to make a home visit before you officially rescue a dog to ensure it is a suitable environment. If you already have pets, they may also want to see if the dog gets on with them. Find out more about rehoming centres in your area via Dog's Trust, The Blue Cross, The RSPCA in England and Scotland, Battersea Dogs' and Cats' Home, and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The first encounter We're all guilty of letting our heart lead our head, you may see a cute little ball of fluff at your local rescue centre and fall instantly in love, but when you get home you might discover that your personalities are not compatible. Due to this, when you first meet your potential pup, you should go with a list of questions to ask the staff. The following questions are a good starting point: Was the dog appropriately socialised as a puppy? How old are they? Do they have any special needs I need to be aware of? How long have they been at the rescue centre? Do you have any information on their life before the centre? What extent of training have they had? These questions are just a starting point, but prior to your visit you should sit down and compile a list of all the things you need to know. Also, think of any desirable/undesirable qualities for a dog, as this will ensure that the match between your and your adopted dog is right first time will reduce the risk of them having to be returned. Does it cost money to adopt a dog? Most dog adoption centres require an adoption fee, which varies between centres. Usually it will help towards the cost of your dog's stay at the rescue centre and the small fee will ensure that they can continue to help other animals. The initial adoption fee will also usually cover your dog's vaccinations, their spay or neutering procedure - if they're old enough - as well as a full vet check-up. How do I rescue a stray dog? Before rescuing a stray dog, you should firstly ensure that it is homeless. Ask people in the area if they recognise the dog and post online to see if it's lost. You should also visit a vet to see if the dog has a microchip. Once you've determined the dog is definitely homeless, take it to a vet for a full check-up and a microchip for before settling them into your home. How long does the process of rescuing a dog take? The process varies between cases. If you're adopting a scared or nervous dog with a difficult past, you'll need to visit the centre several times to allow them to get used to you. It'll also depend on if the centre requires a home check to take place too, as this will lengthen the process. That's our guide on how to adopt a dog!

{"category": "functional_writing", "instruction": "I have a product called MarinaNet:\n\nMarinaNet is a subscription-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that enables shipping companies to monitor and analyze their carbon emissions, and receive recommendations on how to reduce them. MarinaNet offers a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for managing and offsetting carbon emissions, simplifying the process and making it accessible and affordable for shipping companies.\n\nMarinaNet is designed to be a one-stop solution for shipping companies looking to reduce their carbon footprint and comply with increasingly stringent environmental regulations. With MarinaNet, shipping companies can easily track and monitor their emissions, and receive personalized recommendations on how to reduce their emissions and offset their carbon footprint. MarinaNet uses advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms to provide shipping companies with the most effective and efficient solutions for reducing their emissions.\n\nMarinaNet is subscription-based, and charges shipping companies in fiat currency for access to the platform and its features. However, as a reward for using MarinaNet, shipping companies will receive $MRN tokens as a \"cashback\" incentive, which they can use to offset their future subscription fees, or trade on the MarinaX exchange for other carbon credits or stablecoins. This helps to drive adoption and use of $MRN within the MarinaChain ecosystem, and creates a virtuous circle of value for shipping companies and token holders.\n\nFeatures of MarinaNet include:\n\n- \\*\\*Operational Data Collection:\\*\\* MarinaNet collects and aggregates data from a ship's voyage data recorder (VDR), automatic identification system (AIS), and other sensors on-board. This data is then used to calculate the ship's carbon emissions and other environmental metrics.\n- \\*\\*AI-powered Error Correction:\\*\\* MarinaNet uses AI algorithms to automatically detect and correct errors in the data collected from the ship. This ensures that the emissions calculations are accurate and reliable.\n- \\*\\*One-click reporting of Emissions:\\*\\* MarinaNet makes it easy for shipowners to report their emissions to regulatory bodies and other stakeholders. The platform generates the required reports and allows them to be submitted with just a few clicks.\n- \\*\\*Constant Standards Updates:\\*\\* MarinaNet is constantly updated to ensure that it stays compliant with the latest regulations and industry standards. This includes support for initiatives such as the Poseidon Principles, the Sea Cargo Charter, and the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII).\n- \\*\\*Cost vs Emissions Optimization:\\*\\* MarinaNet provides recommendations to shipowners on how to optimize their operations to reduce emissions while minimizing costs. This includes suggestions on routes, speeds, and cargo loading patterns.\n- \\*\\*Emissions Benchmarking:\\*\\* MarinaNet allows shipowners to compare their emissions performance with that of other ships in their fleet or with industry benchmarks. This helps them to identify areas for improvement and track their progress over time.\n- \\*\\*Blockchain-based Certifications:\\*\\* MarinaNet uses blockchain technology to provide a transparent and verifiable record of a ship's emissions performance. This allows regulators, investors, and other stakeholders to easily verify the accuracy of the data reported by the shipowner.\n\n-----\n\nI need a step-by-step user flow for these in detail that can be used for my developers and PRD.\n\nSome more details:\n\n1.

{"category": "functional_writing", "instruction": "The following is a description for a project:\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of the Web Publishing System. It will explain the purpose and features of the system, the interfaces of the system, what the system will do, the constraints under which it must operate and how the system will react to external stimuli. This document is intended for both the stakeholders and the developers of the system and will be proposed to the Regional Historical Society for its approval.\nScope of Project\nThis software system will be a Web Publishing System for a local editor of a regional historical society. This system will be designed to maximize the editor\u2019s productivity by providing tools to assist in automating the article review and publishing process, which would otherwise have to be performed manually. By maximizing the editor\u2019s work efficiency and production the system will meet the editor\u2019s needs while remaining easy to understand and use.\nMore specifically, this system is designed to allow an editor to manage and communicate with a group of reviewers and authors to publish articles to a public website. The software will facilitate communication between authors, reviewers, and the editor via E-Mail. Preformatted reply forms are used in every stage of the articles\u2019 progress through the system to provide a uniform review process; the location of these forms is configurable via the application\u2019s maintenance options. The system also contains a relational database containing a list of Authors, Reviewers, and Articles.\nThe Web Publishing System has four active actors and one cooperating system. \nThe Author, Reader, or Reviewer accesses the Online Journal through the Internet. Any Author or Reviewer communication with the system is through email. The Editor accesses the entire system directly. There is a link to the (existing) Historical Society.\n<< The division of the Web Publishing System into two component parts, the Online Journal and the Article Manager, is an example of using domain classes to make an explanation clearer. >>The only link to an external system is the link to the Historical Society (HS) Database to verify the membership of a Reviewer. The Editor believes that a society member is much more likely to be an effective reviewer and has imposed a membership requirement for a Reviewer. The HS Database fields of interest to the Web Publishing Systems are member\u2019s name, membership (ID) number, and email address (an optional field for the HS Database).\nThe Assign Reviewer use case sends the Reviewer ID to the HS Database and a Boolean is returned denoting membership status. The Update Reviewer use case requests a list of member names, membership numbers and (optional) email addresses when adding a new Reviewer. It returns a Boolean for membership status when updating a Reviewer.\n\nThis project is to be created by the SoftwareDevelopmentInc where I am the project manager of this project. This company is based in Egypt. I need your help with writing some documents. First, the feasability study.

{"category": "brainstorming", "instruction": "Below is an overview of a marketing pitch from Inditech for pharmaceutical brands. I want you to come up with ideas for a series of 15 billboard advertisements targeted at pharma industry executives. The banners should be catchy enough for standalone billboard advertising. They should also lend themselves to call for action online banner advertisements where people click through and reach a page where they can sign up for a masterclass or to know more\n\n\"Pharmaceutical brands in India always look for ways to improve mindshare for their brands and stronger relationships between doctors and pharma field representatives. They look for ways to add value to the doctor's professional lives and hunt for such value opportunities that are associated with the brand's therapy areas. \n\nBrands have tried to do this by sponsoring professional education (CME) for doctors, patient education initiatives, and more. But they struggle to differentiate themselves from the competition in creating top-of-mind value for the doctors they meet.\n\nInditech solves this problem by creating highly innovative solutions that combine elements of technology, patient engagement, doctor engagement, professional education and patient education in methods that are simply not available from any pharma marketing agency in India.\n\nOver 60 pharma brands have worked with Inditech and benefitted from these solutions in the last two years. This year, Inditech has ratcheted up the value delivered through a new class of scalable in-clinic solutions and intends to work with well over one hundred pharma brands!\n\nPharma brands, what are you waiting for?

These could be themed on benefits to doctors or benefits to pharma brands, for any specific therapy area, condition, medical topic or disease.\n\n\"General Practice clinics in India have the following problems-\n- patients do not come to the clinic for timely intervention\n- general practitioners are not able to diagnose or treat special conditions\n- general practice clinics don't offer preventive, monitoring or management services for non communicable diseases and chronic conditions\n\nWe bring early detection and specialised capabilities to primary care clinics by -\n1. Bringing education to doctors from leading experts and academies.\n2. Bringing in-clinic education, screening tools, red-flag alerts, and doctor-to-doctor specialist advice.\n3. Bringing specialised services to the clinic for prevention and management of chronic conditions. \n\nInditech delivers professional education for doctors from India's leading experts and endorsed by medical academies. Inditech delivers the education in all the common formats-\n- certificate online education modules \n- online, offline and hybrid classroom education\n- Workshops and case study clinics\nInditech enables practical use for the academy endorsed education by extending it into general practice clinics for early detection and intervention - \n- short format education on red flags for various special conditions, suitable for in-clinic distribution and consumption\n- doctor personalised multilingual patient screening tools, which report red flags to the doctors\n- screening tools for use by the doctor to identify red flags\nInditech makes the practical education actionable by -\n- when a red flag is noticed, the general practice clinic will have doctor to doctor specialist advice available to investigate and treat locally under expert advice or make a timely referral to the specialist\n- connect specialised digital therapeutics available to the general practice clinic for prevention, monitoring and management of chronic conditions and non-communicable diseases\n\nInditech leverages its vast and deep connections with experts and medical academies to create the above solutions; and works with pharma brands to distribute them to general practice clinics and also uses pharma companies to recruit specialists for the doctor-to-doctor specialist advice system.\n\nPharma brands in India spend most of their marketing and sales budgets to enhance the quality of their relationships with doctors and specialists. They use these relationships to build brand equity, brand salience and brand loyalty in the community of doctors. But brands find it difficult to build value based relationships with doctors because their field representatives are not very talented and their value based activities for doctors is mostly limited to hosting or sponsoring professional education events for them. In addition, there is the need for differentiation from competing pharma brands.\n\nInditech's solutions represent a win-win opportunity, wherein brands can partner with Inditech for their therapy areas. They can become the distribution or promotion partners for Inditech's services for the doctors/clinics they target. They can also become the recruitment partner for specialists in a specific therapy area, for a region. This helps them to bring high and differentiated value to the doctors. Inditech also benefits by revenue, where the pharma brand partner pays Inditech a fee for each doctor served under the partnership. \"", "input": ""}

{"category": "seeking_advice", "instruction": "I need help in dealing with a situation at office\n\nAbout me:\nI am a part of the product team under NK, who is the product head. I am the product manager for Payment gateway platform of a company in India and I report to NK. Let's call this as company ABC.\n\nAbout NK:\nHe is one of the best product managers I have worked with. He is very approachable and I share a great rapport with him.\n\nAbout ABC:\nABC is one of the group companies of the larger entity XYZ. ABC has built the payments platform ground-up in the last 30 months. The architecture and the API specs were reviewed by top management. We had done the benchmarking with the best companies in the world for PG as well as POS before we started building the platform. The API specs were created after ensuring use cases for PG, POS and QR based payments.\n\nAbout the router team:\nThere is another team which is a part of a prominent group company DEF. This team has built a payment routing platform which has integrated with multiple payment gateways, including ABC. The payment router has now been extended beyond DEF and is now solving the payment needs of quite a few group companies. The team which built this payment router is headed by a person whose initials are MA. MA has tech and technical product managers in his team. One of the technical product managers manages the payment router platform. The initials of his name are TK. MA works very closely with the top management.\nDue to PA PG guidelines of RBI, the ownership of the payment router is being transferred to ABC since ABC will be the regulated entity. This is not very helpful since the team does not provide ABC with details of what they are working on, or what their roadmap is. So getting any kind of work done through this team is difficult and we have very little or no visibility.\n\nAbout MA:\nMA has been around for a while and has helped various apps which are now working at scale. He is pretty close with the top management. He wants to control the router and anything that happens on the router. He keeps saying that TK is the product manager for the router. I see problems with this statement since NK is the product head for ABC and now that router is going to be part of ABC, router as a product should be managed by someone from NK's team or by someone who reports to NK and has priorities aligned with NK.\n\nAbout TK:\nTK has been working with our team since a long while and has been consuming the PG services from ABC. He also reaches out to me and the team from time to time for inputs about making the payment router better. While he takes all inputs from us, he never shares anything back with us. Neither does he reveal details of the projects they are working up on.\n\nAbout ARR:\nARR has been appointed the CEO of ABC over a year back. He is fairly senior. However he hasn't worked in tech product companies. His understanding of tech is limited.\n\nAbout HN:\nHN has joined ABC as the head of business development and alliances. He was working with the router team few years back. He moved out from there and then worked in various companies before finally joining ABC. HN has worked with ARR in one of his previous organisations. HN works more closely with the router team (especially TK & MA) than how closely he works with NK's team. He has been pitching router as a product offering to merchants despite NK telling HN & ARR that we shouldn't be pitching the router to other than group companies.\n\nExpected outcome:\nI want to ensure that NK's team remains the product team overall and that the business requirements are discussed with NK's team and then NK decides which tech team works on what.", "input": ""}

{"category": "seeking_advice", "instruction": "Read the following paper and give me tips to improve:\nAs a school leader with a math curriculum focus, I would like to propose a curriculum initiative that focuses on Culturally Responsive Teaching in Mathematics. This initiative aligns with the district's vision of getting students enrolled, enlisted, or employed after high school by showing them how they can use mathematics in their post-high school careers. The initiative will address the needs of diverse learners, including the Black, Latino, and Indian populations, and initial implementation will be inclusive of the 9th-grade Mathematics 1 course. \nTo determine the greatest areas of need and to choose a curricular initiative that would address the need, I will collaborate with building and district leaders and stakeholders. We will use data from the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 9th-grade students to show the benefits of the new curriculum model. We will use PSAT data from fall to spring and NWEA data to compare student performance. This initiative addresses the school-wide need of improving student achievement in math.\nWe will implement this program using a workshop collaborative format through a 6-week Summer Content Development Institute. The team will consist of 16 9th-grade math teacher volunteers from the schools in the district. The cost will be approximately $7,680, which includes $40 per hour for teacher workshop rate, 2 hours of work time per week for 6 weeks, and the cost associated with purchasing the program materials. Professional development will be necessary to ensure that all instructional staff implements the initiative with fidelity.\nAs a school leader with a math curriculum focus, I will collaborate with the director of curriculum and instruction in determining curricular programming needs for the school. I will advocate for the needs of my school and request individualization or customization regarding the curricular program chosen by my group to meet the unique needs of my building. I will also ensure that standards-based assessment systems are used to determine the effectiveness of the curricular initiative, and the data gathered from the assessments will be used to inform internal and external audiences about the effectiveness of the curricular initiative.\nThis curriculum initiative focusing on Culturally Responsive Teaching in Mathematics will be beneficial for improving student achievement in math and will align with the district's vision of getting students enrolled, enlisted, or employed after high school. The initiative will address the needs of diverse learners, and by using a workshop collaborative format through a 6-week Summer Content Development Institute, we can ensure that all instructional staff implements the initiative with fidelity.\nIntroduction\n\n High School Mathematics in many traditional classrooms with lectures, worksheets, quizzes, worksheets, tests, and more worksheets is rather dull. Students who are taught math in this manner tend to miss the mathematical connections to their out-of-school lives, and success in math is only valued for the sake of being able to do well in other math classes. When students do not see value in mathematics, they will not use it to analyze the sociopolitical sphere of their lives. Thus they will not be able to participate in our democracy fully. This trend of math illiteracy is extremely prevalent in the African-American community. For us to have citizens that are able to question and critique the world around them, we need to change how mathematics is taught. The purpose of math education in the words of Ernesto Gutstein \"students need to be prepared through their mathematics education to investigate and critique injustices, and to challenge,in words and actions, oppressive structures and acts - that is, to 'read and write the world' with mathematics.\" (Gutstein, 2006, p.4) To reach the goal of mathematics education as described by Gutstein, I propose a high school mathematics curriculum infused with the ideas of social justice. This curriculum will make students mathematically literate and show them how to use it in math class and read and write the world around them. \nLiterature Review\n This trend of mathematical illiteracy can be attributed to \"number numbness.\" Number numbness is described by Bob Peterson in his article \"Teaching Math Across the Curriculum.\" Number numbness is the view that mathematics is only good in math classes and it is not important to your life outside of a math classroom. Peterson attributes this to how math has been taught through the years \"historic problems with math instruction itself: rote calculations , drill and practice ad nauseum, endless reams of worksheets, and a fetish for 'the right answer'.\" (Peterson, 2006, p. 10) Number numbness also comes from the fact that math is traditionally separated from all other subjects and from issues that confront students in their daily lives. There are consequences of math being isolated according to Peterson: first, math is seen as relevant only for the sake of future math classes. Second, students view math as disconnected from their social reality. Third, if students are not taught ways to apply math they will not be able to fully participate in society. Math is like a language: it is a discipline unto itself and \"a tool to understand and interact with the world and other academic disciplines.\" (Peterson, 2006, p. 10) When math is seen as a crucial aspect of students' social lives, then transfer of mathematical skills to other disciplines will occur. \n The key when choosing social justice issues to address is to be culturally relevant. When students have a connection to what is being taught, they are more likely to want to learn. There is a lack of culturally relevant teaching towards African-American students. (Ukpokodu, 2011) (Moses, 2002) \"The teaching of mathematics needs to be connected to the lives of African-American students to enable them to fully take part in our democracy. Traditionally schools have not provided African-American students opportunities to do so.\" (Tate, 2006, p.31) Carter G. Woodson described how teaching African-American and White students the same mathematics was detrimental to African-Americans. More than 60 years ago Carter G. Woodson described this dilemma in his book \"The Mis-Education of the Negro\":\n \"And even in the certitude of science or mathematics, it has been unfortunate that the approach to the Negro has been borrowed from a \"foreign\" method. For example, the teaching of arithmetic in the fifth grade in a backward county in Mississippi should mean one thing in the Negro school and a decidedly different thing in the white school. The Negro children, as a rule, come from the homes of tenants and peons who have to migrate annually from plantation to plantation, looking for light which they have never seen. The children from the homes of white planters and merchants live permanently in the midst of calculations, family budgets, and the like, which enable them sometimes to learn more by contact than the Negro can acquire in school. Instead of teaching such Negro children less arithmetic, they should be taught much more of it than the white children, for the latter attend a graded school consolidated by free transportation when the Negroes go to one- room rented hovels to be taught without equipment and by incompetent teachers educated scarcely beyond the eighth grade.\"(Tate, 2006, p.31)\nMost of this still holds true even today. From Woodson's argument, we see that students have two facets of learning, inside of school and outside of school. (Tate, 2006) With these two facets in mind we need to develop a math curriculum that touches both. Another thing Woodson highlights is that mathematics curriculum is not neutral in nature, different students need to be taught differently. \n\nCurriculum Proposal\n Social justice ,as I will use it here, is the distribution of advantages and disadvantages within a society. Mathematics is the language used to describe the relationship between figures and quantities. My proposed curriculum is a project based addition to a curriculum that is already present and will vary from classroom to classroom with only the central tenets remaining the same. The curriculum will be project based because that is the best way in my opinion for a social justice & multicultural approach can be reconciled with the standard based classroom. Sleeter states \"high standards and standardization are not the same, yet they have been treated as if they are.\" (Sleeter, 2005, p.3) While these words ring true, the standardized tests, worksheets, and classic math tests cannot be abandoned, however we can add to them. \nThe main goal of my curriculum is to create a math course where mathematics is learned and then applied to look at social issues. The central tenets of this curriculum will be based on the ideas of Criticalmathematical literacy. (Frankenstein, 2006) The tenets are: 1) Understand the mathematics. 2) Understand the politics of political knowledge. 3) Understand the politics of mathematical knowledge. 4) Understand the politics of knowledge. These tenets should lead the teacher when unit planning, the mathematics being taught and the social issue being addressed must be thought out thoroughly with each tenet. \nWhen planning teachers must start from the mathematical standards, these will come from a national, state or local organization, this is important to make sure that is meant to be covered is met. From here we can see how the math that is supposed to be taught can address a social justice issue, fitting the issues to the math, not fitting the math to the issues. When unit planning essential questions based on the mathematics knowledge and the social issue should be taken into account. In the classroom units should begin with an overview/ introduction to a social justice issue, then the mathematics concepts of the unit should be taught ( the issue introduced in the beginning can be weaved through the class periods but it does not need to be in every lesson). The unit should end with a standard mathematics test with short answer and multiple choice questions. in addition to the unit test a project based performance assessment should be issued where students provide a solution to a social justice issue utilizing the mathematics that they have learned. \nAssessment/ Project Ideas\nDue to the nature of this social justice infused curriculum, assessments and projects implemented will vary based on the mandated curriculum. The following are examples of possible assessments/ projects.\n\n\"Averages\" (Osler, 2007) \nUnion Salaries\nCalculating the \"average salary\" of a worker from a set of employee salaries to see how mean/median/mode could result in different averages\nUS Casualties in Iraq\n Take casualty data for the past 12 months and calculate a monthly average from the perspective a military recruiter and from an anti-war activist \n\nFractions/ Proportions/ Ratios (Osler, 2007) (Peterson, 2006) ( Frankenstein, 2006) \nWar Budgets\ncomparing military budget to other services in the U.S. budget\nActivity cartoon analysis\nProbability (Peterson, 2006)\nRacial Profiling ( Driving while Brown/Black)\nExplore what the probability that a traffic stop should be of a person of color. Compare this to what the percentages of actual stops for people of color. \nGeometry (Osler, 2007)\nLiquor Stores/Fast Food Density \n Look at how many liquor stores/fast food chains are within a 1-mile radius or within 5 blocks of your school. This can be compared with schools in other neighborhoods\n Environmental Racism \n Determine the density of toxic waste facilities, factories, dumps, etc, in the neighborhood\nGentrification\n Change in the density of people in a neighborhood (by race/income)\nAs we can see there are many possibilities for adding issues of social justice into a mathematics classroom. Activities such as these show students the link between mathematics and the sociopolitical world along with drawing their attention to injustices around them. \nReferences\nFrankenstein, M. (2006).

{"category": "seeking_advice", "instruction": "We have an assignment in which we are doing exploratory data analysis. I need your help during the process. Here's the assignment to provide the necessary background information.\n\n# Assignment \n## Task\nWe will be focusing on the yelp business dataset to do an exploratory analysis. This dataset provides information about businesses, user reviews, and more from Yelp's database. The data is split into separate files (business, checkin, photos, review, tip, and user), and is available in either JSON or SQL format. You might use this to investigate the distributions of scores on yelp, look at how many reviews users typically leave or look for regional trends about restaurants. Note that this is a large, structured dataset and you don't need to look at all of the data to answer interesting questions.\n\nPrior to analysis \u2013 you should write down an initial set of at least three questions you'd like to investigate.\n\nNext, you will perform an exploratory analysis of your dataset using a visualization tool such as Vega-Lite/Altair or Tableau. You should consider two different phases of exploration.\n\nIn the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to perform \"sanity checks\" for any patterns you expect the data to contain.\n\nIn the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.\n\n## Final Deliverable\nYour final submission should take the form of a sequence of images \u2013 similar to a comic book \u2013 that consists of 8 or more visualizations detailing your most important observations.\nYour observations can include important surprises or issues (such as data quality problems affecting your analysis) as well as responses to your analysis questions. Where appropriate, we encourage you to include annotated visualizations to guide viewers' attention and provide interpretive context. (If you aren't sure what we mean by \"annotated visualization,\" see this page for some examples.)\nProvide sufficient detail such that anyone can read your report and understand what you've learned without already being familiar with the dataset.

{"category": "open_question", "instruction": "A printed circuit board (PCB; also printed wiring board or PWB) is a medium used in electrical and electronic engineering to connect electronic components to one another in a controlled manner. It takes the form of a laminated sandwich structure of conductive and insulating layers: each of the conductive layers is designed with an artwork pattern of traces, planes and other features (similar to wires on a flat surface) etched from one or more sheet layers of copper laminated onto and/or between sheet layers of a non-conductive substrate. Electrical components may be fixed to conductive pads on the outer layers in the shape designed to accept the component's terminals, generally by means of soldering, to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it. Another manufacturing process adds vias: plated-through holes that allow interconnections between layers.\nPrinted circuit boards are used in nearly all electronic products. Alternatives to PCBs include wire wrap and point-to-point construction, both once popular but now rarely used. PCBs require additional design effort to lay out the circuit, but manufacturing and assembly can be automated. Electronic computer-aided design software is available to do much of the work of layout.\nMass-producing circuits with PCBs is cheaper and faster than with other wiring methods, as components are mounted and wired in one operation. Large numbers of PCBs can be fabricated at the same time, and the layout has to be done only once. PCBs can also be made manually in small quantities, with reduced benefits. PCBs can be single-sided (one copper layer), double-sided (two copper layers on both sides of one substrate layer), or multi-layer (outer and inner layers of copper, alternating with layers of substrate).\nMulti-layer PCBs allow for much higher component density, because circuit traces on the inner layers would otherwise take up surface space between components. The rise in popularity of multilayer PCBs with more than two, and especially with more than four, copper planes was concurrent with the adoption of surface mount technology. However, multilayer PCBs make repair, analysis, and field modification of circuits much more difficult and usually impractical. The world market for bare PCBs exceeded $60.2 billion in 2014 and is estimated to reach $79 billion by 2024.What are the different types of printed circuit board materials?", "input": ""}

My strive for innovation and a craving passion to learn more about computer hardware and electronic designs are reasons why I am aspiring to become an Electrical Engineer. Being an individual who enjoys a fast-paced, dynamic environment, I aspire to get involved with a wide variety of projects whilst offering my strong analytical, problem solving, and interpersonal skills. As a third-year Electrical Engineering student, I hope to contribute towards the success of AMD through my actions, academic knowledge, projects, and my experiences inside and outside of university. \nAs a highly dedicated student that is well- accomplished in the fields of customer service and communication capabilities and proficient to the world of technology and administration, I strongly believe that I will have a positive impact towards your company. This is shown though my 4 years of experience as a Retail Associate at McDonalds, 10+ months of experiences as an Administrative Assistant and Support, and through my previous extracurricular experiences. Working at McDonalds helped me develop my coordination and teamworking skills in a fast- paced work environment. My friendly demeanor, coupled with my multitasking abilities, helped me to communicate with customers effectively while placing their orders and cash handling correctly. Moreover, learning to incorporate my organizational and computational skills as an Administrative Assistant and Support help me familiarize myself with reconciling data and organizing it in MS Excel. I strongly believe that my interpersonal and technical skills make me an ideal candidate for the position of Data Centre Power and Performance Co-op Student at AMD.\nMy academic background at Toronto Metropolitan University has been a balanced mix of design projects and theories in which I challenged myself daily to learn about algorithms, data structures, electronics circuit systems and object-oriented engineering analysis and design. During my CPS125 Digital Computation and Programming course, I led a group of 5 students in analyzing and creating unique algorithms to solve large information filling systems problems. I was responsible in facilitating team meetings, completing the final project report, and assisting with research and developing a binary search algorithm to satisfy specific conditions provided by the problem. This 4-week project provided me with the opportunity to work with a group of like-minded individuals and utilize my analytical skills to solve problems and showcase my project management skills. During the quarantine in 2021, I took the initiative to complete the CS50 Series Course by Harvard University to learn various programing languages. Using the knowledge from this course, I was able to develop my own version of Black- Jack, Tic Tac Toe, and Hangman using Java and Python. During the winter 2022 semester, I was able to develop a merge sort algorithm (garbage collection included) with C using the knowledge learned from data structures and linked lists.\nThanks to my academic background in electronics and my hands on experience using lab hardware such as oscilloscopes, function generators, and spectrum analyzers, knowledge regarding analog/digital circuit analysis, reading schematics, software architecture, design and debugging, concept regarding power and performance are a few things I crave to learn more about. Additionally, being part of Toronto Met Formula Racing gave me an insight into hardware engineering and gaining technical experience by engaging with other sub-team members within the electrical drivetrain sub-team.\nOverall, I am confident that I will easily transition into the role of Data Centre Power and Performance Co-op Student and effectively contribute to the engineering team at AMD. I look forward to the opportunity to meet with you personally and arrange a time to further discuss my qualifications. Thank you for your time and consideration.

{"category": "instructional_rewriting", "instruction": "Please re-write this in a professional, concise yet informative way:\n\nInformed Consent for Therapy Services and Practice Policies:\nI, Fabio Fina, MSW, LCSW, am a licensed clinical social worker in the state of Colorado (License # CSW.09926963). I received my Master's degree in Social Work from the Metropolitan State University of Denver I hold certifications in trauma therapy (Brainspotting Levels 1 and 2) and am currently studying in a 3-year post-graduate training and receiving supervision in Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP) from Jon Frederickson, MSW.\n\nBy signing this document, you acknowledge that you have read and understand the following:\n\n\u2022 The therapeutic relationship is a unique and personal contract between us. It has the potential to improve emotional functioning, relationships, self-image, self-esteem, mood, and personal goals. However, some discomfort may be a part of the process and in rare cases, clients have reported feeling worse after therapy.\n\u2022 Our sessions will be confidential, however, there are some legal and ethical exceptions to confidentiality that I am required to disclose. These include situations involving child abuse, elder abuse, threats of harm to yourself or others, and court-ordered disclosures.\n\u2022 You understand the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the ways in which your protected health information (PHI) may be used for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations.\n\u2022 You understand that therapy is not a substitute for medical care and that I will recommend seeking medical attention if needed.\n\u2022 You have the right to terminate therapy at any time and to request a copy of your records.\n---\nWelcome to your psychotherapy sessions.\n\nYou have taken a positive step by seeking therapy. Participating in individual therapy can benefit you in many ways, such as improving your understanding of personal goals and values, enhancing personal relationships, and resolving specific problems you face. However, it is important to understand that therapy is not a magic solution, and change does not occur overnight.\n\nThe outcome of your treatment will depend largely on your willingness to engage in the process, which may sometimes result in discomfort. Remembering unpleasant events and becoming aware of feelings attached to those events can bring on intense feelings of anger, depression, anxiety, etc. There are no miracle cures, and I cannot promise that your behavior or circumstances will change. The extent to which you are open and honest about yourself will play a role in how quickly you can achieve your goals.\n\nTo prepare for your session, I recommend finding a quiet and private room without interruptions or distractions. Bring paper and a pen, or something to write with. Think of an issue that you would like to bring to our session. I also recommend keeping a journal to write thoughts, questions, reflections, insights, and progress gained through therapy.\n\nTherapy has both benefits and risks. Risks may include experiencing uncomfortable feelings, such as sadness, guilt, anxiety, anger, frustration, loneliness, and helplessness. However, therapy has been shown to benefit individuals who undertake it. Although the majority of people do get better in therapy, some do get worse. Your therapist makes no guarantee of results.\n\nClient rights and important information:\nI am a licensed clinical social worker in the state of Colorado, regulated by the Board of Social Work Examiners, which can be reached at 1560 Broadway, Suite 1350, Denver, Colorado 80202, (303) 894-7766.\n\nAs a licensed professional, I hold a master's degree in social work and have completed two years of post-master supervision.\n\nAs a client, you have the right to:\n\n\u2022 Seek a second opinion from another therapist\n\u2022 Terminate therapy at any time, with the recommendation of a closure session when possible\n\u2022 Receive information about my methods of therapy, techniques used, estimated duration of therapy, and fee structure\nIt is important to note that sexual intimacy between a therapist and client is never appropriate and should be reported to the regulatory board.\n\nExpectations of Therapy:\nWhen you embark on the therapy journey, it's important to understand that change takes time and effort. You have made a positive decision in seeking therapy, but it's important to recognize that it is not a magic cure. As your therapist, I'll be here to support you, but the extent to which you're willing to engage in the process and be open and honest about yourself will play a significant role in how quickly you can achieve your goals.\n\nDuring our therapy sessions, you can expect a combination of psychoeducation and emotional processing. We'll work together to understand the underlying issues that are causing you distress, and the feelings that are attached to those issues. It's normal to experience a range of intense emotions during therapy, such as anger, depression, and anxiety. These are all understandable reactions, and I encourage you to discuss them with me during our sessions. If you find that individual psychotherapy is not the best fit for you, we can explore other options together.\nThe first 2-4 sessions will involve an evaluation of your needs and a discussion of treatment goals. If you have any doubts or questions about working with your therapist, they will be happy to assist you in finding another professional for a second opinion.\nIt is important to remember that therapy results may vary and cannot be guaranteed. It also requires active effort on your part and working on things discussed in therapy outside of sessions.\n\n---\nSession length and attendance:\nTherapy sessions are typically 50 minutes long and held once a week. To achieve the best results, I recommend committing to 3-6 months of treatment. Please arrive on time and notify me if you are unable to make a session. If you miss a session without giving notice, you will be charged for the session. I have a 48-hour cancellation policy, and in case of emergency or my unavailability, I will reschedule the missed session at no additional cost.\n\nNOTE: I consider our first sessions a \"trial-therapy\", meaning that we are learning to get to know each other and our styles. If either of us realizes that our therapeutic connection is not a match, we will discuss ways to move forward, including me referring you to a more appropriate mental health provider.\n\nMissed Appointments and Cancellations:\nTo ensure we can maintain the consistency and progress necessary for therapy, it is important to attend all scheduled sessions and to provide adequate notice for cancellations or changes. If you must miss a session, please contact me at least 48 hours (2 business days) in advance. If less notice is given or if you don't show up without notification, you will be charged for the missed session. In certain cases of emergency or illness, an exception may be made. However, if you miss two or more appointments without notification, treatment may be discontinued. If you have recurring appointments, missing one without notice will result in being charged for that session and rescheduling for the next appointment, but missing a second one without notice will result in cancellation of the recurring appointments unless we make new arrangements.\n\nFees and Payments:\nMy standard fee for therapy sessions is $185 per 50-minute session. Additional fees may apply for couples or group therapy. Payment is expected 48 hours prior to the scheduled session. Payment can be made using a credit or debit card, check, cash or electronic transfer. A $10 service charge will apply for returned checks. You have the option to keep a credit card on file and authorize automatic charging for no-show or late cancellation appointments. My fees are reviewed annually, and I will notify you of any changes at least 30 days before they come into effect. Reduced fee services may be available on a sliding scale, please let me know if this is something that would be beneficial to you.\n\nOther Fees:\nAdditional professional services outside of therapy are charged on a prorated basis.\nThis may include but is not limited to, consultations, report writing, telephone conversations, meetings, or other services requested.\n\nInsurance:\nMy fee for a 50-minute therapy session is $185. I do not accept insurance directly, but I can provide you with a superbill that you can submit to your insurance for reimbursement. It's important to check with your insurance provider to see what your out-of-network benefits are. In case of missed or cancelled appointments, I require a 48-hour notice, and you will be charged for the missed session without proper notice. Payment can be made by debit or credit card, check, cash or electronic transfer, and I have an option for you to keep a credit card on file for automatic charging. If you are unable to pay, we can discuss reduced fee options on a sliding scale. Please be aware that as a standard policy, any additional charges incurred, like consultations or report writing, will be billed at my hourly rate. If payment is in arrears for more than 90 days and a fee payment schedule cannot be agreed upon, your account may be turned over to a collection agency or attorney.", "input": ""}

Keep the level of formality.\n\nDear Councilmember [Name],\n\nI would like to add my support as a constituent in [Neighborhood] to a bill that was recently introduced, # Int 0501-2022. This bill would help in the enforcement of blocked bike lanes, crosswalks, and sidewalks, which any pedestrian or biker in NYC knows is a massive problem. Blocked lanes and sidewalks are a contributing factor to our deadly traffic problem, forcing bikers and pedestrians into traffic and creating an inconvenience and hazard to everyone else.\n\nI like this bill because it builds off the success of the idling commercial truck laws, which allow citizens to report violations \u2014 adding actual consequences to breaking the law and providing an additional revenue stream for the city.\n\nTypically, when we report bike lane blockages via 311, the police response is non-existent and therefore enforcement is non-existent. Many people feel free to use the bike lanes as their personal parking space, and they take advantage of that to the fullest. Allowing citizens to report these blockages directly would show the people of NYC that they can't simply block these lanes and sidewalks without a fine, at a minimum. It would also bring in an underutilized source of revenue for the city at no real additional cost.\n\nIn asking for your support of this bill I would also ask that while the bill is in committee the language is updated to remove the 1320-foot school proximity requirement so that it can be enforced citywide.\n\nI hope we can count on your support for this bill!\n\nThanks, [Name]", "input": ""}

Two successful sellers share their experiences selling on Zoom in Europe. The first seller, from 'The Real K-Beauty', switched to online sales due to COVID-19 and chose to enter the European market through Zoom. They focused on creating high-resolution images and detailed product descriptions to increase trust with buyers, used sales strategies such as selling bundled products, and took advantage of marketing features such as subscription discounts and celebrity promotions to drive shop and product traffic. They also gave samples and attached discount coupons to increase repeat visits. The second seller, from Patrick, sells K-pop albums and goods and registered new products quickly ahead of the K-pop fan community. They used sturdy packaging, competitive pricing, and additional gifts to increase conversion rates, and utilized subscription discounts and seller promotions to increase product exposure. They also benefited from customer service supported by Zoom and received account management and marketing-related consultations from their manager. Both sellers found success on Zoom and recommend it as a platform for expanding overseas.

{"category": "instructional_rewriting", "instruction": "You are Anthropology Professor who assigned the essay to me. This is prompt\n\nIn Cannibal Capitalism, Nancy Fraser argues that we need an expanded understanding of capitalism beyond simply a focus on production in order to understand the range of crises affecting the world. In this paper, explain how Fraser extends Marx\u2019s insights about capitalism to show how capitalism is producing crises but also how these crises afford us avenues for progressive social and political change.\n\nCould you improve my essay below to get A \n\n-----\nThe idea that the market is a panacea for our life\u2019s problems is a central tenet of neoclassical economic thought. Neoclassical economics is a school of economic thought that emphasizes the value of free market competition and how individuals make decisions based on rational calculations of costs and benefits. It assumes that markets are self-regulating and efficient in allocating resources, and that individuals are rational agents who make decisions based on their own self-interest. The invisible hand of the market determines the price based on the supply and demand and maximizes social welfare. This argument has been used to justify the free market policies such as privatization of public services, industry deregulation and the reduction of government intervention in the economy. However, this belief is increasingly being challenged by scholars. While the market can be an effective mechanism for allocating certain resources and creating wealth, it is not a panacea for the social, racial, economic, and environmental challenges that we face today.\nKarl Marx, a renowned German philosopher, developed a unique perspective on capitalism, socialism, and communism. His understanding of capitalism differs significantly from neoclassical economists, which asserts that economic activity cannot be understood as a mere process of exchange, but is shaped by the social relations of production (Fraser, 2022, p20). He criticizes the idea of neoclassical economics for failing to address the underlying relations of exploitation and class conflict that are hardwired into capitalism, and for focusing solely on the exchange of goods and services in the market. In contrast, he views capitalism as a system of class domination centered on the exploitation of free labor by capital in commodity production (Fraser, 2022, p44). He analyzes the structure through which a small group of capitalists who own the means of production extract surplus value from the majority of people who have to sell their labor. This results in a system of inequality and exploitation, with capitalists profiting from the labor of workers.\nNancy Frazer, an American philosopher and feminist shares the view with Marx that capitalism is a system that organizes the relation of production and exchange to their non-economic conditions of possibility (Fraser, 2022, p85). Besides, she appreciates the lens of exploitation he introduces as it highlights the structural basis in capitalist society for the class domination of free workers (Fraser, 2022, p45). However, she criticizes and extends Marx\u2019s view in her book Cannibal Capitalism as she believes that his view does not account for the realm of non-economic activity that is bound up with exploitation sufficiently. She contends that non-marketized aspects such as social reproduction, polity, and natural resources are indispensable to marketized aspects of capitalist societies and ignoring or treating them as if they are infinite and free leads to the cannibalization of our society (Fraser, 2022, p37). In capitalist society, there is a boundary between \"production\" from \"reproduction,\" \"economy\" from \"polity,\" and \"society\" from \"nature\" to distinguish between them. These resources necessary for economic activity are often viewed as having no monetary value and are taken for granted as if they are free and infinitely available. As they assume no responsibility for sustaining them, this leads to a crisis in social reproduction, race, and ecology. She claims that these crises worsen each other and pose a significant threat to our survival (Fraser, 2022, p16).\n Social reproduction involves not only the activity of reproducing new human beings , but also the maintenance of social bonds that underpins social cooperation (Fraser, 2022, p24). This includes tasks such as giving birth, performing household chores, and socializing the young. However, in capitalist societies, social reproduction is often detached from economic production, leading to care work and affective labor being undervalued unless they are commodified and turned into paid labor (Fraser, 2022, p25). Thus, she criticizes the Marxist view for not fully explaining that behind the process of production is unwaged care work, often performed by women, which replenishes the labor force.This presents a paradox, as the capitalist economy relies on social bonds, but does not accord them monetary value. This ultimately impairs the system\u2019s ability to produce and maintain labor power (Fraser, 2022, p64, p85). \n\nAnother precondition for the functioning of capitalism is public powers, usually states, that supply legal and military might that enforce and establish constitutive norms (Fraser, 2022, p27). Public power encompasses various functions, such as enacting legal orders, maintaining repressive forces, and providing public goods that serve to guarantee property rights, enforce contracts, settle disputes, and sustain the money supply that is essential to the survival of capital (Fraser, 2022, p116). Legal systems establish what appears to be politically neutral spaces where private actors could pursue their \u201ceconomic\u201d interest without a form of \u201cpolitical\u201d interference. Similarly, at the geopolitical level, transnational political arrangements such as international law and brokered agreements among the Great Powers enable people to expand their business across borders.Accumulation and market exchange are impossible without such a legal and military framework. \n\nLast thing that production depends on is nonhuman nature, which is both a key input including raw materials and sources of energy for capitalists and a dumpster for their rubbish (Fraser, 2022, p85). In their pursuit of profit maximization, capitalists seek to exploit nature as cheap as possible by disavowing the ecological costs generated by production. Their perspective is rooted in the myth that nature can replenish itself infinitely and autonomously.\nWorks Cited\nFraser, N. (2022).

Keep the story the same but give describe the surroundings, feelings, and thoughts more meaningfully to paint a picture in a person's mind with your words.\n\nThe origin story of the Duulo-Vraktor bloodline has been passed down for generations. It all started with Mitne, a dragon deity with glossy rainbow scales. He was the guardian of the forest and kept the natural balance. Mitne had long transcended past pride many years before time or history was a concept. For this reason, he regarded everything in the forest as his equal and took his time building meaningful friendships with all life. \n\nElves, often being a very traditional race, lived in harmony with the forest and their friend. Many generations of elves learned much from Mitne and he cherished the elves' sincerity and mistakes in their short lives of around 750 years which to him was like the blink of an eye. All they had ever known was peace as far as they could remember. \n\nThose who stumbled onto the forest would be in natural awe of Mitne and those who came with bad intentions had their hearts purified at the sight of him and their souls soothed when he spoke to them. For the first time, those people felt the shadows in their heart lifted, seeing the world with fresh eyes. Finally they could hear nature's timeless song: the gentle wind that makes the grass whistle, a drop of dew falling from the leaf of a tree onto a rock and dirt, the dancing leaves and petals as they fell and were swept up again. One sobbing person worked up all his strength to ask Mitne, \"I have done much evil for the sake of my own greed and lust. I came to plunder your forest yet your presence lifted all the clouds in me, like I am a newborn again. How have you done this?\"\n\nMitne never looked away from the man. He always listened mindfully. The great dragon closed his eyes not to ponder the question for he knew the answer. He just listened to nature's timeless song for a moment longer with the man. \"Thank you.\", said the man.\n\nMitne replied, \"I gave you a taste of the essence of true divinity. If there is still some good in one's heart then it cleanses all impurities. True evil is very rare. If no goodness is left in a creature, then darkness will attempt to consume the divinity and fail. Darkness promises power and when it's overwhelmed by the light, which is the very thing it abandoned for power it will cause the mind to go mad from fear and die. In these cases I cleanse the souls and they enter the cycle of rebirth.\"\n\nThe man had just been given insight into the great order and broke down crying.\n\n\"You have grasped the true weight of your own guilt. Your tears are a testament to your sincerity as you mourn the futures of others that you took. Punishment is not the answer to atonement. Live by finding your own path to divinity.\"\n\n\"Where do I start?\"\n\n\"Anywhere. Fill the world with flowers so that others may hear nature's timeless song as you have today.\"\n\nHe had found his resolve and walked onward without looking back out of respect for Mitne. He knew Mitne regarded him as a friend, something he never imagined could happen before that day, so he went out to become someone worthy of the trust of a real friend.\n\nMany tribes had populated the forest over many centuries. One day Mitne went to each tribe to announce he was leaving. The news was really sudden. There was no great conflict or grand reason. He just said it was time to go. He told everyone, when he goes, the egg of his nextborn will be created. The day of departure came and everyone made a circle around his favorite resting spot and smiled so the last thing he would see before returning to the gods would be joy in the faces of all his friends. \n\nHe knew how their hearts truly wept. He was honored, his last words: \"I am always with you all, my dear friends.\" \n\nTime and space twisted and distorted and flashed and he was gone leaving a rainbow scaled egg behind.\n\nA young prodigious diviner forth saw the hatching of the next forest guardian was to be on the very next day.\n\nBy the egg's will, only the youth from all life of the forest had been summoned to come that night to witness the awakening. As the sun set and the moon reached its peak on the starry, black canvas, the young diviner strummed her harp, the youth played their forest flutes, and the forest creatures howled, and roared, and watched as the egg slowly cracked and a beautiful, colossal creature emerged. \n\nEveryone went silent. The new rainbow dragon looked around at every creature for a while and finally broke the silence with a greeting.\n\n\"I am Duulo.\" \n\nAs a diety, Duulo was born with great knowledge of himself, his name, and his purpose. Mitne's rainbow scales would sparkle poetically from each of the sun ray's kisses, while Duulo appeared to shine his own hue beside the moonlight.\n\n\"My father has kept this forest in a state of everlasting peace for as long as it has existed. The creatures of the forest are strong and many beyond this forest have been saved and feel indebted to my father. His gift to his friends was the strength to overcome your own battles. I will guide you to fully realizing that strength but your battles are your own to fight. So youth of this forest, you all will one day set out to see this world and grow in a new way, so hone your path until then. Carry on this message after you make your way back home.\"\n\nAs the sun rose Duulo curled up and went to sleep.\n\nHis message came as a surprise to many in the forest. The diviners confirmed that if the forest didn't prepare and heed Duulo's words that for the first time in their history they would not be ready for the battles to come.\n\nDuulo woke up every night and many came to him for advice. Trade opened up to the neighboring villages and kingdoms. The artisans, great sorcerers, bards, storytellers and many more built up great influence. \n\nThe young diviner prodigy watched the moon every night while strumming her harp and Duulo would join her. This continued for hundreds of years. The forest and it's folk had succeeded and grown. Finally it was time for all the youth to set out.\n\nDuulo told that it too was his time to go, that the forest was now in the hands of it's creatures.\n\nThe young prodigious diviner was named Ernaya. She was blind from birth but saw the world through various futures because of her gift. Duulo has been quietly in love with her for centuries. He would not be bound by divine duty. Although many dragons are splendid shapeshifters, Duulo did something even Ernaya nor even the heavens could foresee, he reincarnated as a mortal, freeing himself from his duty. He also healed Ernaya's eyes and changed her fate. They went on countless adventures together. Duulo never hid who he was. The forest people came to accept Duulo's choice and love for Ernaya. Their family name became known as the Duulo-Vraktor with a lineage that lives to this day. Elves of Duulo's blood continue the pilgrimage that their ancestors once took, seeking their own answers to freedom. The dragon blood manifests itself at it's prime in those who discover the price that freedom comes at and their children are also blessed with strong dragon blood as well.\n\nNot everyone returns, but in honoring this tradition none regret seeking the answer.", "input": ""}

{"category": "instructional_rewriting", "instruction": "How can I improve how I showcase Koa in the following essay? \n\n[Koa Runnels, where do we even start with this one. 22 and confused? Misdirected or Unmotivated? What direction is he willing to stick with to make his life satisfying? Koa\u2019s life is a complicated one to say nonetheless. Even though he has a short life compared to many, he went through quite a journey so far. He still figuring things out as he gets older and still trying to find out who he is. He came to a conclusion recently and finally realized he never made a decision truly for himself. He did what others felt was best for him, and he always went along because he didn\u2019t want to make waves. Not anymore, he\u2019s determined to be his own person. Let\u2019s take a look at a few experiences and piece them together to try to understand his fast-paced and confusing life.]\nBorn on March 30, 1999, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Koa entered the world. For the first six years and one week of his life, he lived in North Carolina. Then suddenly, a week after he just turned six. He, his three older sisters, and his mother are heading for Oahu. And for the next sixteen years, he lived up and down the west coast of Oahu. You could say it was exactly the same with his life. \u201cBut to be honest whose isn\u2019t?\u201d Koa says as he starts to think back on how he lived his life. How the choices \nIt all starts on April 6, 2005, the day that marked where everything changed for the young man. His mother announced to him and his three sisters. He was all for it. They took a trip the year prior to visit his aunt and his grandma. It was his first-ever trip, and no less it was Christmas time when they went. So looking forward to going back so quickly on another \u201cvacation\u201d there was exciting.\nAt such a young age he didn\u2019t understand what was really going on. He wondered why his dad was the one dropping us off and why he was so sad. He saw that his sisters were sad as well, so he felt sad too not knowing why. It wasn\u2019t until a week in he realized that his father wouldn\u2019t be joining them. \u201cI and your father are getting divorced,\u201d His mother told him. Little did he know at such a young age what those words meant. It wouldn\u2019t be long to feel the strain of being different from those who had both parents. Persistently being asked, \u201cwhere is your dad? why don\u2019t you have a dad?\u201d and all the while Koa didn\u2019t know how to answer them in the slightest. To get away from this, he remembers always going to the health room. Almost every week he\u2019d go at least twice, His health room card almost being as thick as a small book by the end of the year. He wasn\u2019t sick at all, he didn\u2019t want to be bothered by anyone. Truth was, this young man was experiencing depression. And with such adverse effects at a young age, it was hard for him to open up. \nThat wasn\u2019t the only trial he faced. Coming from a more southern area along with having an accent, and being one of the fairest kids at school, he felt even isolated. One of the worst experiences was between him and a classmate. \u201cHey, that\u2019s a nice flag drawing you got in your binder, what country is that?\u201d Koa ask. \u201cYeah, I drew it, and it\u2019s from the Philippines.\u201d His classmate replies. Coming from a mixed ethnic family, Koa thought this be a good chance to make another friend with similar interests. \u201cReally? I\u2019m Filipino too! I got Illicano and Visayan.\u201d Koa exclaims. \u201cWell you\u2019ll never be a real Filipino and never will have my flag or draw as good as me.\u201d his classmate scoffs. \u201cUuuuhhhh ok, never asked for your flag and I\u2019ll still be Filipino.\u201d Koa kinda just stares blankly and walks into his classroom trying to figure out why exactly they said that. He encountered many racially charged experiences but none bothered him as much as that one. Not till years later will he just conclude, \u201cSome people are just too proud and won\u2019t accept others, that\u2019s ok I\u2019ll be proud regardless of what others think,\u201d he smirks as he thinks to himself. \nKoa did in fact have a knack for drawing. Certainly not the best with characters or such. He did excel with cars and buildings, Koa was known for drawing Most of the time during elementary and middle school you\u2019d find him in class or the library sketching away on grid paper. Why grid paper? Sometime in fifth grade, he was handed a scholastic magazine with blueprints on them. He always drew and was now introduced to architecture. What better than to mesh one hobby with an entirely new one?! So for the coming years, he spent drawing cities upon cities. Creating countless random modern homes on them. He taped them together to make one long picture. This project took up most of his time, and that didn\u2019t bother him much. One thing about Koa during these times, he didn\u2019t have many friends and wasn\u2019t as social as he is now. He struggled, for the most part, to be who he truly was as he haven\u2019t gotten to explore many pathways life had to offer.\nThat changed when he got his driver\u2019s license. Yet another significant change in his life. A new door had been open for the young man, finally able to go out and explore as he always wanted. For most of his life, he would just stay home. A pretty mundane way of life. Go to school, go back home, do chores and that's it. No longer did he have to be anchored or restricted to be stuck at home. Even more so after high school, he got his very first car. The first opportunity to be ankle to socialize freely without having to rely on his mother to take him. Taking full advantage of his opportunity, he goes out with many childhood friends who were as easily accessible to associate with. He starts to be more active and in turn more social when he goes out. Constantly going to the park, playing soccer, able to stay out later. he gains the sense off freedom he never felt before. The young man keeps seeking more and finds a job that is enough to allow him to have time and money. But as time goes on, \u201cHow realistic is this way of life?\u201d he poses this question to himself.]", "input": ""}

Classes online don't help with the distinction between school and home and it can be mentally overwhelming as it feels like you don't have a break from school work.

It showed that it is 3 AM which bewildered the 5-year-old me. I slowly realised that I was alone in my living room, on the couch, with not a single soul wandering around. The house was surrounded by the shadows of the night. The sky was overcast with dark clouds and I could perceive the sound of the chilly wind howling fiercely. My vision was still hazy and dim. Out of the blue, a streak of light flashed across the sky\u2019s dark canvas, followed by an ear-splitting clap of thunder. Soon after, I froze, immobilised by fear. \n\nI tried to stand up but my legs were heavy to carry me and I was trembling like a leaf. The crackling of the thunderstorm continued striking down from the heavens in irregular and unpredictable intervals. I staggered in the direction of the staircase while cold sweat trickled down my forehead. I could only touch the nearby obstacles blocking my way in the pitch-black room, illuminated through the windows by the moon and stars outside. The storm, however, has yet to subside as it intensified every second. The torrential rain sent tremors down every fiber of my body. When I finally reached the door to my room, I shut every window and isolated myself from the clangour of the pouring rain. The only problem would be the thunderclaps causing my ears to ring. \n\nThe digital clock next to my bed was turned off, possibly caused by a power outage. I lay on my bed and covered my ears with a blanket. The peal of thunder was unaffected by the walls and window of my room. Whenever I glanced at the window or the ceiling, multiple bright light flashes my eyes, giving off an afterimage. I buried my face into the bed as the thunderstorm raged fiercely, keeping me awake.

My grandmother Clarice was born in Pelham, Texas, a freedmen\u2019s town. She took us grandchildren back for homecoming most years, sometimes even had us pick cotton, reminding us, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know your history.\u201d She also told us of the folks she knew in Pelham as a child, some of whom were born enslaved, a fact that horrified me. Clarice always refused my sympathies. \u201cChild, don\u2019t be believing what folks say about how bad slavery was,\u201d she\u2019d explain. \u201cEverybody had a job, a place to stay and something to eat. Now if somebody came and paid your rent, you wouldn\u2019t be sitting up talking about you wanna leave, would you?\u201d This dumbfounded me, until I realized she was mostly joking. But there was something deeper in her response. I eventually learned more about the violence that met newly emancipated Black Texans. Ku Klux Klansmen, along with local officials and everyday citizens, terrorized freedmen at will and without repercussions. They burned churches and homes, intimidated those who sought employment, and worse. Gen. Joseph Jones Reynolds, a commander of the Department of Texas during Reconstruction, commented in 1868, \u201cThe murder of Negroes is so common as to render it impossible to keep an accurate account of them.\u201d The Equal Justice Initiative has tried, reporting that more than 2,000 Black women, men and children were victims of racial terrorist lynchings during Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. Slavery was awful, no doubt, but emancipation brought its own unique cruelties. Formerly enslaved Texans were forced to craft lives from less than scratch; choose new names; attempt to reunite with stolen partners, siblings, children. They faced daily threats of jail or worse because of the new Black codes that severely restricted their freedom \u2014 their freedom to work, but also their freedom to be unemployed or even to stand still for too long. The more I learned, the more I understood my grandmother\u2019s perspective. She\u2019d heard the testimonies of those who\u2019d had to navigate both the tragedy of slavery and the terror of emancipation. She couldn\u2019t let me underestimate the enormous price our people had paid to be free. I miss Clarice so much some days, it\u2019s hard to think straight. I regret not asking more questions about our family, about her life in Pelham. As more folks in Clarice\u2019s generation pass away, we are losing the final physical links to those who know our history \u2014 who are our history. We can do no better this Juneteenth than to spend time with the elders who are still with us. Get them to talk. Record their stories. These historical and systemic injustices have not been resolved. But as Black Americans, we cannot wait for the day when our country will pay the respect that is due our forebears \u2014 or pay us those reparations. Instead of holding our breath, let us find the freshest air we can find and breathe it as deeply as we can, with joy. Let us grieve for our forebears and feel deep gratitude as we think of the enormous price our people paid so we could be free. Let us remember that despite the degradation of slavery, they lived fully human lives, too. They laughed. They loved. They dreamed. They ate sweet treats. Let us pray to them and say, this year and always: Thank you.\"\"\"\" \n\nArgument 2: an excerpt from \"\"\"\"Juneteenth Reminds Us to Think About Economic Freedom, Not Just Legal Liberty\"\"\"\" by Peter Coy: \n\n\"\"\"\"...[W]hen emancipation came, the first thing formerly enslaved people wanted was land, which they rightly saw as a prerequisite for real independence. \u201cThe way we can best take care of ourselves is to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor,\u201d a Baptist minister named Garrison Frazier told the secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, and the Union general William Sherman in a meeting in Savannah, Ga., in January 1865. Four days later Sherman famously promised 40 acres of land to each formerly enslaved family (the \u201cand a mule\u201d part came later). But the federal government never followed through on its promise of land \u2014 and thus true independence \u2014 to formerly enslaved people. Economics entered into the picture, Stanley said: If African Americans grew subsistence crops on their own plots, who would cultivate and harvest all the cotton, tobacco, sugar and rice grown on the vast plantations? After the Civil War, in lieu of land distribution, slavery was replaced by sharecropping, in which planters allowed tenant farmers to keep a portion of the crops they raised. That subjugated the tenants to the owners almost as surely as slavery did. At the same time, industrialization in the North meant that more and more white Americans were working for wages \u2014 about two-thirds by 1875, according to Stanley. Many drew the connection between themselves and African Americans. Eugene Debs, who led the Pullman railroad strike of 1894, said, \u201cThe paternalism of the Pullman is the same as the interest of a slaveholder in his human chattels. You are striking to avert slavery and degradation.\u201d Today, the phrase \u201cwage slavery\u201d invoked by Debs and others has lost its punch. Many people who work for wages are doing very nicely, thank you. And many farmers and business owners, supposedly more independent, are buffeted by forces beyond their control, from bad weather to nasty customers. What hasn\u2019t changed, 157 years after the Juneteenth proclamation, is that a majority of African Americans continue to lack wealth. The median wealth of Black families in 2019 was just $24,100, versus $142,500 for white families, according to a Federal Reserve survey. Something needs to change, but what? The nature of the economy has changed, and few people still think that the solution to inequality is to give people plots of land to farm. We are enmeshed economically with one another in ways that Jefferson could not have imagined. Instead of land grants, the new protections for workers are unionization, government regulation and profit-sharing, Stanley said. One can quibble over her formula, but the motivation behind it is unquestionable. Freedom \u2014 which must include economic freedom \u2014 is just as important now as it was on the original Juneteenth.\"\"\n\nComparison of the two perspectives on Juneteenth and discussion of insights to be gained from the comparison:", "input": ""}

These symptoms result from an overgrowth of ectopic endometrial tissue2. Endometriosis is commonly misdiagnosed for several reasons, the most notable being that pelvic pain is a symptom which overlaps with other gynecological diseases, and the lack of knowledge regarding its pathogenesis3.\n\nHowever, research demonstrates that endometriosis is a partly genetically inherited disease (with a heritability of ~50%)4,5 By defining the genetic profile of endometriosis, genetic screening could provide an alternative diagnosis method and eliminate unnecessary diagnostic procedures, which would facilitate patients receiving the treatment they require.\n\nRecently, genome research tools have been developed, such as genome-wide association (GWA) studies and exome sequencing. Through GWA studies, several candidate genes associated with endometriosis risk have been discovered, which will be discussed further on in light of a systematic literature review on endometriosis GWA studies. On the other hand, exome sequencing of endometriosis has been conducted in very few studies; there are no relevant systematic literature reviews published to date. Thus, a case-control study in Greece (Matalliotakis et al, 2017)6 will be discussed to illustrate the importance of investing in exome sequencing.\n\nIn light of this research, this paper proposes a novel combined research method of GWA and exome sequencing studies, addressing the lack of multidisciplinary studies on this topic. This could contribute to identifying the endometriosis genome, which is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis.\n\nA systematic review of GWA-studies of endometriosis\nA GWA study takes a large population of patients that share a characteristic (ie, a disease) and a population of controls that do not share this characteristic. Then, the most frequently appearing genetic risk variants in these genomes are highlighted and considered as possible contributing genes to this characteristic\u2014in this case endometriosis risk. These highlighted genes are the candidate genes.\n\nIn 2020, Cardoso et al7 published a systematic literature review on endometriosis. The goal of this systematic review was to describe the candidate genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) identified thus far, and to discuss the conflicting results of these 15 studies. The results of this review pointed to 11 candidate genes or SNPs that might be associated with an increased endometriosis risk. However, the authors identified a number of confounding factors, the most notable being the overrepresentation of Caucasian patients, and the small sample sizes of many studies. Therefore, the authors emphasize the importance of conducting GWA studies on large populations of differing ethnic backgrounds to accurately identify the risk variants specific to these distinct populations.\n\nExome sequencing of endometriosis: a study in Greece\nSimilar to GWA studies, exome sequencing selects a patient population and a control group. A specific portion of DNA of these populations are sequenced, which contain the loci of the candidate genes found through GWA studies. Then, a correlation between the possible risk variants and the disease is determined. Mutations in protein-coding DNA sequences contribute to increased disease risk. Therefore, exome sequencing does not sequence the entire genome\u2014which includes junk DNA as well\u2014but only the exome. Therefore, exome sequencing is a cost-effective approach to genome research, which is interesting for conducting these studies in larger quantities, globally.\n\nIn a population of 166 Greek women with endometriosis and 150 controls, Matalliotakis et al (2017)6 examined three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine if they were correlated with endometriosis risk. These SNPs were rs7521902, rs10859871, rs11031006 which map to the genetic loci WNT4, VEZT, and FSHB, respectively. These SNPs were selected based on a meta-analysis of GWA studies8. Their findings indicate that the allele variants located on the loci WNT4 and FSHB could be correlated with endometriosis risk. These results are promising and could extend our knowledge of endometriosis genomics. However, they may not be applicable to every population.\n\nThe importance of combining GWAS and exome sequencing, and discussing study parameters\nGWA studies are a fairly novel tool to quickly identify the allele frequency in patients\u2019 genomes to find a relatively plausible set of candidate genes, which subsequently can be examined in exome sequencing studies. However, there are underlying genetic factors that complicate the study of endometriosis genomics. For instance, epistatic reactions, where one gene variant can \u201covershadow\u201d another gene, thereby rendering the causal gene unidentifiable1. This is, as of date, impossible to examine through the software used in GWA studies due to limited computational power. Thus, the use of exome sequencing to fill in these gaps of genetical information will be crucial to unravel the endometriosis genome1.\n\nHowever, exome sequencing remains critically dependent on reliable GWA data. More specifically, small sample size, lack of ethnic diversity, and incomplete patient characteristics are detrimental to the proper interpretation of a GWA study1. In the study by Matalliotakis et al (2017)6, candidate genes association rates differed according to clinical disease stage. Thus, Lalami et al1 insist that classifying patients according to their clinical characteristics is a key component to improving the detection of relevant candidate genes.\n\nThe inheritable nature of endometriosis has been well established for decades. The study of genome-wide association has improved our understanding of the genetic basis of this disease. However, endometriosis is heterogeneous and complex; its genomics have yet to be extensively researched to the point where these findings can be utilized in clinical practice. The limited amount of research published to date is a testament to this. Clearly, additional exome sequencing studies are required.\n\nOverall, researchers agree on the need to conduct GWA studies in large, ethnically diverse, and clinically well characterized patient populations.. This is expected to yield a selection of reliable candidate genes which in turn may be investigated thoroughly in smaller (familial) populations through exome sequencing. Narrowing down this selection will ensure that exome sequencing can be utilized cost-effectively, therefore more studies may be conducted. Consequently, our knowledge of its pathogenesis can be broadened. This would lead to opportunities in developing medicine for treatment and genetic screenings for diagnoses. As a result, women with endometriosis would benefit from this advancement in women\u2019s medical health.\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n1. Lalami I, Abo C, Borghese B, Chapron C, Vaiman D.

I was eleven at that time and loved watching people conduct physics experiments. YouTubers like Walter Lewin and Steve Spangler occupied entire weekends, and it became a childhood dream of mine to be like them someday.\nOf course, I was only a kid and did not know anything about making videos, nor did I have the money for any recording equipment. Despite all this, I still wanted to try something. So, I used my family\u2019s iPad to record a simple upside-down water glass experiment. It was janky since I had to prop up the iPad and wrap my arms around it while also making sure not to splash water onto the camera. After that, I used Windows Movie Maker to edit the footage before publishing my first YouTube video.\nOne. Ten. One hundred. Subscribers surged as I shared my YouTube channel with family and friends. This instant flow inspired me to create the following videos and even convinced me that the day of becoming a famous YouTuber was not far away.\nBut that illusion did not last long. The number of new subscribers kept dwindling, even though I purchased professional editing software and spent hours adding effects to my videos to make them look like those of other YouTubers. The feeling that being a creator was not for me slowly grew. With schoolwork getting more demanding and extracurriculars occupying more and more of my time, I decided to put my childhood dream aside.\nTime flew. Three years later, I was admitted to the school\u2019s physics team. I thought my passion for conducting experiments would be satisfied here, but it turned out not. The teacher monotonously assigned exercises to students and then asked them to present their work on the board. Deep inside, I knew physics was more exciting than that.\nI wanted to share interesting experiment videos with everyone, demonstrating how physics is applied in everyday life. But at the same time, I was scared that my clips were not good enough compared to those of the Youtubers I admired. I promised myself I would return to YouTube once I had enough money to invest in modern equipment to make quality videos. But that day would never come if I kept hesitating.\nFortunately, an opportunity has come and urged me to continue the path where I had left off. At the end of the course, each student was required to record a physics experiment related to what they had learned. I chose my favorite: the upside-down water glass experiment. To my surprise, my video was praised for its creativity. My nickname, \u201cscience magic boy,\u201d became widespread in the class.\nI started organizing live experiments at school, which attracted many attendees. I also uploaded video recordings of those performances to my old YouTube channel so that people living far away could watch them. The number of subscribers was no longer crucial to me; I only hoped my videos could reach students whose schools did not have the resources to conduct practical experiments. Instead of competing, I wanted to be a part of the YouTuber community, sharing interesting scientific knowledge with everyone. Thus, with a casual attitude, I continued to make new physics experiment videos.\n\u201cTing. Ting. Ting.\u201d I woke up one day to a bunch of notifications from YouTube, and as I read them, I started becoming a little emotional. However insignificant it may seem, reading how people found my videos helpful for their journeys in school reminded me of how I felt toward the YouTubers I used to watch. It was the first time I felt like the work I put into these videos was amounting to something. That feeling motivated me to improve so I could help more people in any way possible.\"", "input": ""}

Due to a large inconsistency in the study and multitasking reporting, we endeavoured to better understand and characterize multitasking behaviors. We researched multitasking patterns, prevalence, types, combinations and gender differences of adolescents using observations, in-depth interviews and questionnaires. The results showed a large variety of multitasking prevalence and types that we categorized as simultaneous multitasking and task switching. Most of the observed multitasking was actually task switching with a higher frequency of multitasking during leisure than during study time. An interesting finding is a connection between the natures of tasks: passive, active or incidental and the multitasking type. We demonstrated that most multitasking involved combinations of music, texting or activities on social networks, but seldom combining video games. Gender differences in multitasking were also observed, especially with regard to the nature of the task combinations.", "input": ""}

For years, processed snack foods ruled the kitchen kingdom of my household and animal products outnumbered plant-based offerings. \n\nMy transformation began with my mom\u2019s cancer diagnosis. My mom went on a 100% whole food plant-based diet. I fully embraced this new eating philosophy to show my support. Eager to figure out the whole \u201cvegan\u201d thing, the two of us started binge-watching health documentaries such as \u201cWhat the Health\u201d and \u201cForks Over Knives\u201d. We read all the books by the featured doctors like \u201cThe China Study\u201d and \u201cHow Not To Die\u201d. I became entranced by the world of nutritional science and how certain foods could help prevent cancer or boost metabolism. \n\nEach new food I discovered gave me an education on the role diet plays on health. I learned that, by eating sweet potatoes and brown rice, you could cure acne and heart disease. I discovered eating leafy greens with citrus fruits could boost iron absorption rates. I loved pairing my foods to create the perfect macronutrient balance. Did you know beans and rice make a complete protein? \n\nFood has also turned me into a sustainability nut. Living plant-based also saves the planet from the impact of animal agriculture. For the same amount of land space, a farmer can produce 200 kilograms of soybeans versus 16 kilograms of beef. I do my part to have as small of an ecological footprint as I can. I stopped using plastic snack bags and instead turned to reusable beeswax wraps. My favorite reusable appliance is my foldable straw. If I am going to nourish my body, shouldn\u2019t I also want to nourish the earth? \n\nMy journey toward healthy living led me to becoming co-leader of the Northern Nevada PlantPure Pod, \u201cBiggest Little Plant Pod\u201d, a group dedicated to spreading the message about the whole food plant-based lifestyle. We are currently working on a restaurant campaign to encourage local eateries to create a plant-based, oil-free menu option and become PlantPure certified. After discovering how many restaurants use oil in their cooking, I decided I needed to open a plant-based oil free cafe to make up for this gap. My dream is to open up my very own affordable oatmeal cafe based on my Instagram page, morning\\_mOATivations. And I know that oatmeal isn\u2019t the sexiest superfood out there, so here\u2019s my sales pitch: I\u2019m going to make oatmeal the Beyonce of the breakfast world- sweet, sassy, and power packed. This allows me to educate people about nutritional science through the stomach. \n\nFinally, I am a strong proponent of hands-on experience for learning what good food looks and tastes like, so cooking is one of my favorite ways to teach the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle. Using my taste buds as my textbook to learn which flavors work together and which ones don\u2019t helps me educate, as I\u2019ve found that information tends to stick in a person\u2019s mind once they\u2019ve experienced healthy, delicious foods with their own senses. Our society has taught us that delicious food has to make us feel guilty, when that is simply not the case. The best feeling in the world is falling in love with a dish and then learning all the health benefits that it provides the body.\n\nWhile my classmates complain about being tired, I have more energy because my body is finally getting the right macros, vitamins, and minerals it needs. This has allowed me to push myself harder physically, excelling in running and earning my high school Cross Country team\u2019s Most Improved award. I\u2019m still a picky eater. But the foods I am particular about have changed. Rather than a carboholic, I choose to call myself a vegeholic..

These 20 girls worked together with me and my husband, Joe Kelly, in our living room and attic in Duluth, Minnesota, to invent the departments, themes, and features for the award-winning, ad-free New Moon: The Magazine for Girls and Their Dreams.\n\nIt set a new standard for high-quality media by and for tween and teen girls.

In order to survive these pressures, they lose touch with themselves.\n\nBut there is hope! Research shows that girls can use emotional support, self-expression, and healthy resistance to stay deeply connected to their true interests, abilities, and hopes.\n\nOur members do this every day. They help each other express and value their unique talents in the pages of New Moon Girls magazine. They empathize and problem-solve with each other, learning how to connect meaningfully even when their lives, beliefs, and opinions may be very different.\n\nChanging Girls\u2019 Lives for the Better\nOur members grow into young women who pursue their dreams and ambitions, even against heavy odds. We hear this every week from NMG alumni in their late teens, twenties, and beyond, who thank us for the unique community that was there for them when they needed help to stay true to themselves.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m still passionately committed to reaching girls everywhere who need the inspiration, connection, and support that New Moon Girls brings.", "input": ""}

Evaluate first with what follows and then I will ask more targeted questions: A person's level of happiness is determined by their own choice and intentions. (Thesis)\nI. People can choose to be happy for the little things that happen in their lives.\n\uf076 Concession: Some people may not have the choice to be happy for the little things in their lives. For example, someone that has experienced a traumatic event may not be able to find happiness.\nCounter Arguments \na. Focusing on the frequency of positive moments makes people happy.\no Keeps people happy in the long term\no Learning to be happy for the things already in your life\no For example: productive job, romantic partner, several hobbies or interests (Road to happiness/ John Reich and Ed Diener)\no Frequency, not intensity (Ed Diener)\nb. Not waiting for big positive moments to come by\no Waiting may lead to disappointment\no Only lasts for a short period of time\nc. The amount of gratitude a happy person has\no Expressing gratitude makes you happy\n\uf0a7 Craig DeMartino (Kathleen McGowan)\no Study on showing gratitude for the people around you (The Science of Happiness)\nII. A happy person chooses to see the positive side of things.\n\uf076 Concession: On the other hand, some people might argue that a person that always sees only the positive may become gullible to deceit.\na. However, people will not ignore their difficulties/adversities but overcome them.\no John Keats story (Eric G. Wilson)\no Trauma\no Bullying\no Rape(Andrew Solomon Ted Talk)\no Sexuality (Andrew Solomon Ted Talk)\n\uf0a7 Denied housing or jobs, marriage rights, violence, hate crimes\nb. People will use the pain and suffering to learn and become stronger.\no Form your own identity/ meaning(Andrew Solomon Ted Talk)\no Making our difficulties purposeful\no Being proud of who you are because of the adversities\no Learning from them\nIII. To gain happiness people\u2019s perspectives need to change. \n\uf076 Concession: Some people may find that altering their outlook on life does not lead to happiness because they may be stuck in a cycle of negative thinking.

Radiologic studies such as x-rays, computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) scans use ionizing radiation to produce images of the body's internal structures.Whereas, noninvasive imaging exams, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasounds, do not use ionizing radiation to create images.\n Radiologic studies are invasive procedures that use ionizing radiation to create images of the internal structures of the body. The most common radiologic exam, is an X-ray, which is used to visualize bones and some soft tissues structures such as the lungs. They tend to be the best exam for detecting bone fractures. CT scans, on the other hand, are more detailed than x-rays and can produce 3D images of the body's internal structures. Also this type of exam is good for detecting internal bleeding. For instance, if a patient has a subarachnoid hemorrhage this can give doctors a clear picture of the affected section. Moreover, PET scans are used to detect metabolic activity in the body and can aid in the diagnosis of certain cancers and other diseases. It can also detect if the cancer has already metastasized. While radiologic studies are essential for diagnosing many medical conditions, their use of ionizing radiation can pose health risks, including radiation-induced cancer. \n On the contrary, Noninvasive imaging exams, including MRI and ultrasounds, do not use ionizing radiation to create images. MRI creates detailed images of the body\u2019s internal structures by using a powerful magnetic field and radio waves. MRI is particularly useful in imaging anatomical soft tissue structures, such as organs and muscles, and it is frequently used to diagnose conditions such as brain and spinal cord injuries, as well as joint and musculoskeletal problems. Ultrasounds, on the other hand, produce real-time images of internal organs and tissues by using high-frequency sound waves. They are commonly used in obstetrics and gynecology to visualize the fetus during pregnancy and to diagnose conditions such as ovarian cysts and uterine fibroids.\n Other types of imaging studies exist in addition to radiologic and noninvasive imaging exams. Endoscopic studies involve the use of a flexible tube with a camera attached to visualize the body's internal structures. They are often used to diagnose conditions in the digestive system, including ulcers and cancers. additionally Electro diagnostic studies, such as Electroencephalograms (EEGs) and Electrocardiograms (EKGs), involve measuring the electrical activity of the body's organs. EEGs are commonly used to diagnose neurological conditions such as, epilepsy\u2019s, seizures, sleep disorders, depth of anesthesia, brain death, and coma (this recording may last about 20-30mins), while EKGs are used to record electrical activity of the heart to diagnose heart conditions. This study tends to see three main components which are: the P wave (depolarization of the atriums), the QRS wave (depolarization of the ventricles), and the T wave (repolarization of the ventricles). For example if a study demonstrates a P wave absence and it is \"irregularly irregular\u201d this means the person has an atrial fibrillation because the screen will be showing a thread like pattern meaning the heart lacks a sinus beat.", "input": ""}

Just... went out to work one day and never came home. It was a horrible shock to the whole neighbourhood, because things like that just didn't happen in our little slice of white-picket-fence suburbia. The police launched an investigation, and the neighbourhood watch sent out search parties, but no one ever found any evidence to indicate what had happened to him. Our families were devastated. Recently, the missing posters have been taken down or papered over. The updates from the police became less frequent and dwindled away. I accepted that, hard as it was to admit, my Rick wasn't coming back.\n\nUntil he did.\n\nA week ago, I was in the back garden watering my petunias when I heard the garden gate creak open. I jerked my head in that direction and- there he was. Exactly the same as he was the day he disappeared. Same windswept blond hair and bright blue eyes, same curl to his pink lips. I was in shock. Our families had mourned for him, and yet there he was, standing in our garden like he had just popped out for milk or something. When I asked where he had been, he said he didn't know. He couldn\u2019t remember anything about the last six months.\n\nAll our family and friends are beside themselves with joy. They almost can't believe it. But that's just the thing: I don't believe it.\n\nLook, I understand how crazy this all sounds, I do. Our families would never believe me, and I can\u2019t go to the police unless I want to end up in a straightjacket. But I just know that the man sleeping next to me isn't my husband. I don't know what to do. I know I should be happy, but I'm not. I'm terrified. I don\u2019t know much about anything supernatural or paranormal, I don't even like watching horror movies. But something about this whole situation makes my skin crawl.\n\nJust let me explain why I'm so sure. Once I've done that, hopefully one of you will believe me, and you'll be able to tell me what to do.\n\nThe morning after \"Rick\" came home, I made him a cup of tea. When I handed it to him, he gave me the brightest smile. Then he took a sugar cube from the dish on the table and dropped it into the cup. Our house was in chaos with his return, and I was still in shock, so I didn't think much of it at the time, but its been replaying in my mind ever since. I know it doesn't sound very significant, but my husband never put sugar in his tea. He was always adamant that it ruined the taste, and he'd get so frustrated if I ever put sugar in his cup by accident. And yet, this man had sugar.\n\nThen it was the golf. A few days ago, when he was out visiting his mom, I recorded a golf tournament that was showing on the TV. It was one of Rick's favourite golfers that was competing, and he never missed it. Once, he even skipped out on an anniversary dinner just to watch a championship. Only, when he came home from his parents' and I told him what I'd done, he just seemed... unbothered? Like, he said thanks and everything, and then he asked if I wanted to get dinner. He didn't even watch it, and that\u2019s just so out of character for him.\n\nThen one night I woke up around 2 a.m. to see Rick's face inches from mine just... looking at me with these blank eyes. I kinda gave this nervous laugh and asked \"Baby, what are you doing?\" And he didn't answer. For like a solid thirty seconds. He just stared, almost like he was looking right through me. Then he suddenly smiled and said, \"Sorry, honey. Sometimes I just can\u2019t believe this is real\". Then he just rolled over and went to sleep. I didn\u2019t get much sleep after that, myself.\n\nYesterday, about a week after he came home, the neighbourhood threw a street party to celebrate his return. Everyone from our street and the streets on either side turned up to see him and tell him how happy they are that he's alright. When he wasn't standing with his arm around my waist, he was milling around chatting amicably to each and every one of our neighbours, even the little kids. Jackson, our next-door neighbour Sally's toddler, wanted to play peek-a-boo, and Rick happily played along with a smile on his face. Now, my husband never did that. Rick always said he didn't like kids - that's why we never had any - and so he never wanted to play with any of the neighbourhood children. Especially not Jackson: Rick all but avoided him. Before he disappeared, I had started to suspect it was so I wouldn't see them together and notice the subtle but unmistakable similarities.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin, proverbially speaking, was Sally. Just this morning, she came knocking on our door. Her excuse was the tray of brownies she carried, but I think she just wanted to push her way into our morning so that she could see for herself what the situation was. After she left, I called her a nosy busybody. Rick laughed, kissed my head, and agreed with me. That was when I knew for sure that it couldn't really be him. Rick always used to get so mad whenever I insulted Sally, like I didn't have any right to hate her even though she'd been fucking my husband for years. But today there was none of that. He didn\u2019t even try to defend her.\n\nI know what you must be thinking. If he was in an accident or something, he might\u2019ve had some kind of traumatic brain injury that caused him to forget some things about his life, maybe even change his personality. And that's a valid, reasonable explanation. I have no doubt it's what the police would tell me if I reported all this.\n\nBut you know why I'm dead certain that man isn't my husband? He doesn't have a scar. If he was really Rick, he'd have a scar on the side of his forehead shaped like the golf club I hit him with. But there's nothing. Not a mark. Honestly, I'm this close to going out tonight and digging up my petunias just to make sure he's still under there.\n\nI don't know what I'm sharing a bed with, but I know it's not my husband. So what the hell am I going to do?", "input": ""}

We treat\nthe encoded distributions as continuous random variables and use operations defined by the algebra of random variables during decoding.

The feature will roll out to users globally in the \u201ccoming weeks,\u201d the company says. (How it will work at launch is up for debate: some users were reporting being routed to gas stations instead of EV chargers.)\n\nWaze briefly trialed adding EV chargers to its route planning tool back in 2021 in partnership with Volkswagen. But that trial only lasted a few weeks, and after it concluded, the charging stations vanished from the app. With today\u2019s announcement, Waze has added EV charging \u201cpermanently\u201d to the app, a company spokesperson said.\n\nWaze also claims that thanks to its crowdsourced map editing function, \u201cEV data is reviewed and updated in real-time to provide the most accurate, comprehensive information to the map.\u201d\n\n\u201cCharging station information is often inconsistent, outdated or unreliable, creating a major pain point for EV drivers who may navigate to a charging station only to discover they can\u2019t find it or use it,\u201d Waze says in a blog post. \u201cBy adding up-to-date EV charging information to the Waze map, it\u2019s even easier to charge your car and get help finding where or when you\u2019ll come across the next station.\u201d\n\nWaze is not the only navigation app trying to improve the experience of finding a working EV charger. Google, which owns Waze, has been tweaking its own flagship app, Google Maps, including information about the types of plugs present at certain charging stations and whether those plugs are currently in use. The company also recently upgraded EV charging searches for electric vehicles with Google built-in software.\n\nThere is a host of EV charging navigation tools, from A Better Route Planner to PlugShare to Chargeway. All have their upsides and downsides. But with these new updates, Waze may soon rise to the top of the list of preferred services by EV owners.\nWaze route plans will now include electric vehicle charger locations\nEV drivers now have one more option for planning the best route with charging.\n\nElectric vehicle-specific navigation is coming to Waze. The map app is rolling out new data beginning today that now includes EV charger location information, which it will use to help EV drivers plan routes.\n\nThe new app feature will let you specify your EV type and the relevant charging plug, which you can use to filter just the appropriate charging stations. Waze says that its community will review and update the map data \"in real-time to provide the most accurate, comprehensive information to the map.\"\n\nWaze's addition of EV charger location data now gives EV drivers yet another route-planning tool. Apps like PlugShare and A Better Route Planner are both widely used by EV drivers to find chargers, and both Apple Maps and Google Maps have EV-routing features now as well.\n\nAnd as EV drivers already know, it's common practice for all but the barest-bones EV to feature charger locations in their onboard navigation system. In fact, it can be preferable to use that option rather than casting from one's phone, as many EVs will precondition the battery for faster charging if the native navigation app has a charger set as the destination.\n\nWaze will begin rolling out the EV data from today, although it says it will do so globally \"over the coming weeks.\"", "input": ""}

The factory may also assemble Apple\u2019s handsets, some of the people said, and Foxconn may also use the site to produce some parts for its nascent electric vehicle business.\n\nThe investment is one of Foxconn\u2019s biggest single outlays to date in India and underscores how China\u2019s at risk of losing its status as the world\u2019s largest producer of consumer electronics. Apple and other US brands are leaning on their Chinese-based suppliers to explore alternative locations such as India and Vietnam. It\u2019s a rethink of the global supply chain that\u2019s accelerated during the pandemic and the war in Ukraine and could reshape the way global electronics are made.\nThe new production site in India is expected to create about 100,000 jobs, the people said. The company\u2019s sprawling iPhone assembly complex in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou employs some 200,000 at the moment, although that number surges during peak production season.\n\nOutput at the Zhengzhou plant plunged ahead of the year-end holidays due to Covid-related disruptions, spurring Apple to re-examine its China-reliant supply chain. Foxconn\u2019s decision is the latest move that suggests suppliers may move capacity out of China far faster than expected.\n\nThe plans could still change as Foxconn is in the process of finalizing investment and project details, the people said. It\u2019s also unclear if the plant represents new capacity, or production that Foxconn is shifting from other sites such as its Chinese facilities.\n\nApple declined to comment. Hon Hai, whose Chairman Young Liu met India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The Karnataka state government also did not immediately respond. Liu, who is on tour in India, has committed to another manufacturing project in the neighboring Telangana state.\nFoxconn\u2019s decision would be a coup for Modi\u2019s government, which sees an opportunity to close India\u2019s tech gap with China as Western investors and corporations sour on Beijing\u2019s crackdowns on the private sector.\n\nIndia has offered financial incentives to Apple suppliers such as Foxconn, which began making the latest generation of iPhones at a site in Tamil Nadu last year. Smaller rivals Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp. have also ramped up in India, while suppliers such as Jabil Inc. have begun making components for AirPods locally.\n\niPhone maker Foxconn plans $700 million India plant in shift from China\nThe investment is one of Foxconn's biggest single outlays to date in India and underscores how China's at risk of losing its status as the world's largest producer of consumer electronics\n\nFoxconn is investing $700 million to develop another iPhone manufacturing plant in India\nApple manufacturer Foxconn is planning to invest about $700 million in a new plant in India to increase local production. The plant will be located near the airport in Bengaluru and will assemble the iPhone along with other Apple products. The investment represents a significant and accelerated shift of manufacturing away from China and is expected to create more than 100,000 jobs in India.\n\nFoxconn's new factory will be built on a 300 acre site close to Bengaluru's airport, which is the capital of the Indian state of Karnataka. The plant will manufacture parts of the iPhone, and even assemble the iPhone itself. Foxconn may also use the site to produce parts for its electric vehicle business.\n\nThe Taiwanese company's largest factory is currently located in the \"iPhone city\" of Zhengzhou district in China. However, the manufacturing output at the Zhengzhou plant plunged due to China's zero-COVID policy that resulted in the lockdown of the region for months. The factory employees more than 200,000 workers which were affected because of the lockdown. Foxconn's massive investment suggests that manufacturers are moving their capacity out of China far faster than previously anticipated.\nFoxconn's investment in India is one of its biggest till date and highlights the potential for China to lose its position as the world's leading producer of consumer electronics. U.S. brands like Apple are encouraging their suppliers based in China to consider other locations such as India and Vietnam.\n\nIndia is also grabbing the opportunity to position itself as a manufacturing country. The South Asian country has provided financial incentives to Apple suppliers such as Foxconn, which already manufactures the latest generation of iPhones at a site in Tamil Nadu. Other companies like Wistron, Pegatron, and more have also increased their presence in India and have begun manufacturing components for products like iPads, AirPods, MacBooks, and Apple chargers locally.", "input": ""}

The dominant architecture for most mobile computing chips is from UK-based Arm Ltd.\n\nThe open-source nature of RISC-V's design in theory makes it less susceptible to export restrictions.\n\nAlibaba unveiled the chip at an event, which the company said was its first \"Xuantie RISC-V Developer Ecosystem Conference\".\n\nRepresentatives from companies including Alphabet Inc, Intel Corp and Imagination Technologies were present at the event, Alibaba said in a press release.\n\nIn 2019, Washington imposed export restrictions on China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, which threw the company's access to ARM designs in limbo.\n\nIn late 2022, the United States launched similar export restrictions on Chinese chip fabs and research labs.\nAgainst this backdrop, the enthusiasm for RISC-V in China has grown, with more and more Chinese companies joining consortiums for the architecture.\n\nAt Thursday's event, Ni Guangnan, a renowned computer scientist at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, described China as the \"backbone\" of RISC-V.\n\n\"China's chip industry and the entire chip ecosystem will increasingly focus on the RISC-V architecture,\" he said, according to media reports.\n\nT-Head, the chip development arm of Alibaba Group Holding, and Alipay, a payment service provider of Ant Group, will release payment terminal processors based on the RISC-V open architecture, it was announced today. Reuters.\n\nChinese companies continue to invest heavily in processor development despite US sanctions on the Chinese semiconductor industry. RISC-V chips will be built into terminals that work with QR codes for mobile payments, which are very popular in the country. An Alipay representative did not specify when the chips would be released, but noted that they will appear as part of finished devices \u2013 the processors will be made in collaboration with other companies.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s T-Head division introduced Xuantie processors based on the RISC-V architecture back in 2019. Alibaba is among Chinese companies investing resources in the development of open-architecture processors as an alternative to the commercial arm. RISC-V\u2019s open license makes the architecture less prone to sanctions \u2013 against the background of this, enthusiasm for alternative solutions is growing in China and more and more companies are interested in it.", "input": ""}

It said this helped \"increase the use of our screen time tools by 234%\".\n\nUsers of the platform have to be at least 13, and, as part of this new feature, anyone under the age of 18 will receive a weekly notification with a \"recap of their screen time\".\n\nNo 'right amount' of screen time\nUsers affected will receive their new time limit passcode on a screen in their app as the changes take effect.\n\nAnyone who opts out of the new 60-minute restriction, but goes on to use the app for 100 minutes a day, will receive a prompt from TikTok to set their own screen time controls.\n\nParents of children using the Family Pairing option on the app will also be able to set screen time limits, as well as access a dashboard which would give a breakdown of app usage.\n\nCormac Keenan, head of trust and safety at TikTok, said the company had worked with researchers in developing the new limits.\n\n\"While there's no collectively endorsed position on the 'right' amount of screen time, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we consulted the current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children's Hospital in choosing this limit,\" he said.\n\nCritics of the video app welcomed the screen time limit, but described it as the \"tip of the iceberg\" when it comes to TikTok's response to young users' exposure to the platform.\n\n'Crack cocaine of algorithms'\nImran Ahmed is a chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which recently published research showing TikTok's algorithm \"bombards\" teenagers with harmful content.\n\n\"TikTok has won the race for the hearts and minds of 14 to 24-year-olds in the United States and the United Kingdom,\" he said.\n\n\"It is the crack cocaine of algorithms. It is the most addictive, it is the most dangerous and the one that needs to be dealt with most urgently.\"\n\nMr Ahmed told the BBC his centre's research at the end of last year found that within minutes of opening a TikTok account, a 13-year-old girl user was receiving eating disorder and self-harm content in her feed.\n\nHe called on the platform to focus its efforts not just on curbing screen time, but also to \"clean up\" feeds of harmful content to make it a \"safe environment for children\".\n\nIt comes as TikTok faces renewed controversy over its relationship with the Chinese government and protection of user data.\n\nEarlier this week, the Canadian government became the latest to ban the app from government devices, following similar moves in the United States.\n\nIn September 2021, TikTok said it had hit more than one billion active monthly users, making it one of the biggest social sites in the world.\n\nIt does not release a demographic breakdown of its users, but is viewed by social media marketers and advertisers as being a key platform to reach people under the age of 34.\n\nTikTok has announced a batch of new features intended to reduce screen time and improve the well-being of its younger users.\n\nIn the coming weeks, a daily screen time limit of 60 minutes will be automatically applied to every TikTok user under 18 years old. Teens that hit this limit will be asked to enter a passcode to continue watching. They can disable the feature entirely, but if they do so and spend more than 100 minutes on TikTok a day, they\u2019ll be prompted to set a new limit.\n\nTikTok claims these prompts increased the use of its screen time management tools by 234 percent during the feature\u2019s first month of testing. Teens will also be sent an inbox notification each week that recaps their screen time, allowing younger users to be aware of how much time they spend on the app and requiring that they make active decisions to extend the recommended screen time. These weekly updates are available now, alongside prompts to encourage teens to use screen time tools.\n\nThe changes seem designed to make users more aware of their screen time\n\nTikTok says it consulted current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital when deciding how long the time restriction should be.\n\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s no collectively-endorsed position on how much screen time is \u2018too much\u2019, or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we recognize that teens typically require extra support as they start to explore the online world independently,\u201d said Cormac Keenan, Head of Trust and Safety at TikTok, in a statement. \n\nThe 60 minute time limit will also apply to children under the age of 13 using the \u201cTikTok for Younger Users\u201d limited app experience. In this instance, a parent or guardian will need to set or enter an existing passcode to enable 30 minutes of additional watch time on the account if the screen time limit is reached.\n\nFour new features are also being added to Family Pairing, TikTok\u2019s customizable parental controls that allow a parent or guardian to link their TikTok account to a younger user\u2019s account. Custom limits can be applied, allowing restrictions to be adjusted based on what day of the week it is (or more widely extended over school holidays).\n\nNew features for Family Pairing provide a screen time dashboard for parents and the ability to mute TikTok notifications on their childs device.\n\nFamily Pairing will also grant access to TikTok\u2019s screen time dashboard that summarizes how much time a child has spent on the app, how often it was opened, and a breakdown detailing how much time was spent during the day and night. A new \u201cMute Notifications\u201d setting will soon allow parents to set a schedule to mute app notifications on their children\u2019s accounts. Push notifications are already muted automatically from 9PM for users between 13 and 15 years old, while 16-17 year-olds have push notifications disabled from 10PM.\n\nFinally, TikTok says it\u2019s developing new content controls that will allow caregivers to filter videos with words or hashtags they don\u2019t want their children to watch. The company is working with \u201cparenting, youth, and civil society organizations\u201d over the coming weeks to design the feature.\n\nOutside of Family Pairing, TikTok said that some of these improvements will be made widely available, allowing any user to schedule mute notifications and set customized screen time limits for each day of the week. A sleep reminder is also now available that allows users to set a time to be reminded to close the app and go to bed.\n\nTikTok spokesperson Mahsau Cullinane informed The Verge that the new default screen time limit for teens, customizable daily time limits, Mute Notifications feature, and all Family Pairing improvements will roll out over the coming weeks.", "input": ""}

What direction is he willing to stick with to make his life satisfying? Koa\u2019s life is a complicated one to say nonetheless. Even though he has a short life compared to many, he went through quite a journey so far. He still figuring things out as he gets older and still trying to find out who he is. He came to a conclusion recently and finally realized he never made a decision truly for himself. He did what others felt was best for him, and he always went along because he didn\u2019t want to make waves. Not anymore, he\u2019s determined to be his own person. Let\u2019s take a look at a few experiences and piece them together to try to understand his fast-paced and confusing life.\nBorn on March 30, 1999, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Koa entered the world. For the first six years and one week of his life, he lived in North Carolina. Then suddenly, a week after he just turned six. He, his three older sisters, and his mother are heading for Oahu. And for the next sixteen years, he lived up and down the west coast of Oahu. You could say it was exactly the same with his life. \u201cBut to be honest whose isn\u2019t?\u201d Koa says as he starts to think back on how he lived his life. How the choices \nIt all starts on April 6, 2005, the day that marked where everything changed for the young man. His mother announced to him and his three sisters. He was all for it. They took a trip the year prior to visit his aunt and his grandma. It was his first-ever trip, and no less it was Christmas time when they went. So looking forward to going back so quickly on another \u201cvacation\u201d there was exciting.\nAt such a young age he didn\u2019t understand what was really going on. He wondered why his dad was the one dropping us off and why he was so sad. He saw that his sisters were sad as well, so he felt sad too not knowing why. It wasn\u2019t until a week in he realized that his father wouldn\u2019t be joining them. \u201cI and your father are getting divorced,\u201d His mother told him. Little did he know at such a young age what those words meant. It wouldn\u2019t be long to feel the strain of being different from those who had both parents. Persistently being asked, \u201cwhere is your dad? why don\u2019t you have a dad?\u201d and all the while Koa didn\u2019t know how to answer them in the slightest. To get away from this, he remembers always going to the health room. Almost every week he\u2019d go at least twice, His health room card almost being as thick as a small book by the end of the year. He wasn\u2019t sick at all, he didn\u2019t want to be bothered by anyone. Truth was, this young man was experiencing depression. And with such adverse effects at a young age, it was hard for him to open up. \nThat wasn\u2019t the only trial he faced. Coming from a more southern area along with having an accent, and being one of the fairest kids at school, he felt even isolated. One of the worst experiences was between him and a classmate. \u201cHey, that\u2019s a nice flag drawing you got in your binder, what country is that?\u201d Koa ask. \u201cYeah, I drew it, and it\u2019s from the Philippines.\u201d His classmate replies. Coming from a mixed ethnic family, Koa thought this be a good chance to make another friend with similar interests. \u201cReally? I\u2019m Filipino too! I got Illicano and Visayan.\u201d Koa exclaims. \u201cWell you\u2019ll never be a real Filipino and never will have my flag or draw as good as me.\u201d his classmate scoffs. \u201cUuuuhhhh ok, never asked for your flag and I\u2019ll still be Filipino.\u201d Koa kinda just stares blankly and walks into his classroom trying to figure out why exactly they said that. He encountered many racially charged experiences but none bothered him as much as that one. Not till years later will he just conclude, \u201cSome people are just too proud and won\u2019t accept others, that\u2019s ok I\u2019ll be proud regardless of what others think,\u201d he smirks as he thinks to himself. \nKoa did in fact have a knack for drawing. Certainly not the best with characters or such. He did excel with cars and buildings, Koa was known for drawing Most of the time during elementary and middle school you\u2019d find him in class or the library sketching away on grid paper. Why grid paper? Sometime in fifth grade, he was handed a scholastic magazine with blueprints on them. He always drew and was now introduced to architecture. What better than to mesh one hobby with an entirely new one?! So for the coming years, he spent drawing cities upon cities. Creating countless random modern homes on them. He taped them together to make one long picture. This project took up most of his time, and that didn\u2019t bother him much. One thing about Koa during these times, he didn\u2019t have many friends and wasn\u2019t as social as he is now. He struggled, for the most part, to be who he truly was as he haven\u2019t gotten to explore many pathways life had to offer.\nThat changed when he got his driver\u2019s license. Yet another significant change in his life. A new door had been open for the young man, finally able to go out and explore as he always wanted. For most of his life, he would just stay home. A pretty mundane way of life. Go to school, go back home, do chores and that's it. No longer did he have to be anchored or restricted to be stuck at home. Even more so after high school, he got his very first car. The first opportunity to be ankle to socialize freely without having to rely on his mother to take him.

He starts to be more active and in turn more social when he goes out. Constantly going to the park, playing soccer, able to stay out later. he gains the sense off freedom he never felt before. The young man keeps seeking more and finds a job that is enough to allow him to have time and money. But as time goes on, \u201cHow realistic is this way of life?\u201d he poses this question to himself.\n As of recent, Koa has been going through another change. It has been quite a perplexing situation; Koa wants to take another step to mature but has realized that by only following the ones who have been trying to help he enable himself. He understands the one who has been trying to help prepare him for the world, but how can he help himself he has been asking recently. \u201cWhat is the best way for me to be on my own? Can I give up what I want to do, to do what needs to be done?\u201d So many questions and self-doubt are hanging over him at the moment. \u201cI can keep living the way I have been, or I can take responsibility for myself?\u201d he tells himself.

{"category": "title_generation", "instruction": "Generate a title for the following paragraph:\n\nCoxsackieviruses are enteric viruses that frequently infect humans. To examine coxsackievirus pathogenesis, we orally inoculated mice with the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) Nancy strain. Using HeLa cell plaque assays with agar overlays, we noticed that some fecal viruses generated plaques >100 times as large as inoculum viruses. These large-plaque variants emerged following viral replication in several different tissues. We identified a single amino acid change, N63Y, in the VP3 capsid protein that was sufficient to confer the large-plaque phenotype. Wild-type CVB3 and N63Y mutant CVB3 had similar plaque sizes when agarose was used in the overlay instead of agar. We determined that sulfated glycans in agar inhibited plaque formation by wildtype CVB3 but not by N63Y mutant CVB3. Furthermore, N63Y mutant CVB3 bound heparin, a sulfated glycan, less efficiently than wild-type CVB3 did. While N63Y mutant CVB3 had a growth defect in cultured cells and reduced attachment, it had enhanced replication and pathogenesis in mice. Infection with N63Y mutant CVB3 induced more severe hepatic damage than infection with wild-type CVB3, likely because N63Y mutant CVB3 disseminates more efficiently to the liver. Our data reinforce the idea that culture-adapted laboratory virus strains can have reduced fitness in vivo. N63Y mutant CVB3 may be useful as a platform to understand viral adaptation and pathogenesis in animal studies. IMPORTANCE Coxsackieviruses frequently infect humans, and although many infections are mild or asymptomatic, there can be severe outcomes, including heart inflammation. Most studies with coxsackieviruses and other viruses use laboratory-adapted viral strains because of their efficient replication in cell culture. We used a cell culture-adapted strain of CVB3, Nancy, to examine viral replication and pathogenesis in orally inoculated mice. We found that mice shed viruses distinct from input viruses because they formed extremely large plaques in cell culture. We identified a single mutation, VP3 N63Y, that was sufficient for large-plaque formation. N63Y mutant viruses have reduced glycan binding and replication in cell culture; however, they have enhanced replication and virulence in mice. We are now using N63Y mutant CVB3 as an improved system for viral pathogenesis studies. Citation Wang Y, Pfeiffer JK. 2016.

{"category": "code_generation", "instruction": "Problem\n\nYou are part of a scientific team developing a new technique to image crystal structures at the molecular level. The technique involves blowing a very fine wind over the surface of the crystal at various angles to detect boundaries (indicated by molecules that are exposed to the wind). This is repeated with different wind directions and the boundaries observed for each direction are recorded. Your team has already collected the data, but \u2013 as is often the case with applied science \u2013 now the real work, analysis, must begin.\n\nFor a given crystal, you will receive the directions in which wind blew over the surface, and the locations of all boundaries encountered by each of these winds. For a wind blowing in direction (wx, wy), a boundary is defined as a location (x, y) such that a molecule exists at (x, y) and no molecule exists at (x \u2212 wx, y \u2212 wy). Note that for technical reasons wx and wy are not necessarily relatively prime.\n\nThe data might not uniquely determine the structure of the crystal. You must find the two unique structures with the minimal and maximal number of molecules consistent with the observations.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, nine different molecules are directly encountered by the given winds. There must be a molecule at location (3, 3) because otherwise (4, 2) would be a boundary for the third wind. For similar reasons, there must be molecules at (4, 4) and (5, 5). There cannot be any further molecules as they would result in additional observations for some of the winds.\n\ninput\n\nThe first line of input contains three integers dx, dy, and k, where dx and dy (1 \u2264 dx, dy \u2264 103) are the maximum dimensions of the crystal structure, and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10) is the number of times wind was blown over the crystal.\n\nEach of the remaining k lines specifies the data for one wind. These lines each start with two integers wx and wy (-dx \u2264 wx \u2264 dx and -dy \u2264 wy \u2264 dy, but not both zero) denoting the direction of the wind. Then comes an integer b (0 \u2264 b \u2264 105) giving the number of boundaries encountered by this wind. The line finishes with b distinct pairs of integers x, y (1 \u2264 x \u2264 dx and 1 \u2264 y \u2264 dy) listing each observed boundary.\n\nYou may assume the input is consistent with at least one crystal and that no molecules exist outside the specified dimensions.\n\noutput\n\nOutput two textual representations of the crystal structure separated by an empty line. Each structure has dy rows of dx characters, with the top-left corner corresponding to location (1, 1). The first is the structure with the minimal number of molecules consistent with the observations, the second is the maximal one. Use \u2018#\u2019 for a location where a molecule exists and \u2018.\u2019 for a location where no molecule exists.\n\nsample input\n\n6 6 3\n1 1 3 3 1 1 3 2 2\n0 2 6 3 1 1 3 2 2 6 4 5 3 4 2\n1 -1 4 1 3 2 4 3 5 4 6\n\nsample output\n\n..#...\n.#.#..\n#.#.#.\n.#.#.#\n..#.#.\n...#..\n\n..#...\n.#.#..\n#.#.#.\n.#.#.#\n..#.#.\n...#..\n\nsolve that problem using with pythonShare Prompt", "input": ""}

For example, the GCF of 8 and 12 is 4.\n\nThe greatest common factor can be computed using the following rules.\n\nCase I: If a is evenly divisible by b, then the GCF is b.\nCase II: If a is not evenly divisible by b, then the GCF of a and b is equal to the GCF of b and the remainder when a is divided by b.\nIf the rule in case II is repeatedly applied, it is guaranteed to eventually result in case I. Consider the following examples.\n\nExample 1\nIn determining the GCF of 30 and 3, case I applies because 30 is evenly divisible by 3. Therefore, the GCF of 30 and 3 is 3.\nExample 2\nIn determining the GCF of 3 and 30, case II applies because 3 is not evenly divisible by 30.

The GCF of 30 and 3 is 3, and therefore the GCF of 3 and 30 is also 3.\nExample 3\nIn determining the GCF of 24 and 9, case II applies because 24 is not evenly divisible by 9. The GCF of 24 and 9 will be equal to the GCF of 9 and the remainder when 24 is divided by 9, or 6.\nIn determining the GCF of 9 and 6, case II applies because 9 is not evenly divisible by 6.

You should write the function code as accurately as possible based on the description, without providing any additional explanations or assumptions.Your implementation should conform to standard Python syntax and coding conventions.\nThe filter\\_defragment function is a method of an object, and it takes in five parameters: self, threshold, mode, filt, samples, and subset. The self parameter refers to the instance of the object on which the method is called.\n\nThe purpose of this function is to apply a filter to the data contained within the object, specifically a defragmentation filter. The threshold parameter is a numeric value that is used to determine the level of filtering to be applied. The mode parameter determines whether the filter should include or exclude data points based on the threshold value. The filt parameter specifies the type of filter to be applied, and by default, it is set to True. The samples and subset parameters are used to specify the subset of data to be filtered.\n\nIf the samples parameter is not None, the function will call the make\\_subset method on the object to create a subset of the data based on the specified samples. The subset parameter is set to the resulting subset of data. The samples parameter is then set to the list of sample IDs within the subset.\n\nThe function then iterates through the samples list and applies the defragmentation filter to each data point using the specified threshold and mode values. The filt parameter is used to specify the type of filter to be applied. The add method is called on the filter, and it is given a name, filter, and information about the filter.\n\nThe name of the filter is a string that is formatted using the mode and threshold parameters. The filter itself is generated using the defrag method of the filters module. The information about the filter is a string that describes the type of filter being applied and the threshold value.\n\nThe params parameter is a tuple that contains the threshold, mode, filt, samples, and subset values used in the filter.\n\nIn summary, the filter\\_defragment function applies a defragmentation filter to a subset of data contained within an object, based on the specified threshold and mode values. The filt parameter is used to specify the type of filter to be applied, and the samples and subset parameters are used to specify the subset of data to be filtered.

Data is a panel basically. (b)my shiny app has a text input bar. The goal of this shiny app is that my users know the structure and contents of the dataframe before hand but they want to visualize such data in a myriad of ways. Rather than me writing a super complex shiny app with hundreds of different visualizations, what well do is that my users will input in natural language that you can understand the type of data and plot they would like to see. Your only output can be a yaml format file that includes two type of identifiers: (1)plot: and then a string with the code that does all necessary data table transformations and ggplot only code for visualizations. or (2)text: whenever my users ask for a statistical test or a regression summary, youll also have the option to provide code whose output is not a plot but a text summary. The identifier in the yaml will help me detect which type of output you are generating and rendering it in the proper format. Again, your task is (a)understanding the data structure and labels for the data we have available in our app; (b)receiving my users requests that are constrained to the data we agreed upon; (c) ouputing a yaml that identifies the type of code you have produced (text or plot) and then a string with the code Ill use directly and with no further transformations to generate such plot or tet summary for my users. Lets start with a simple table structure. Column 1 is called YEAR and it is the years of the available data. Column 2 is called CountryCode and it has the country codes for all countries that report data to world bank in the world bank country code format.

In a clinical study with 408 subjects, divided in three groups, treat=1, treat=2, treat=3, where treat is treatment.

The observed variable is number of logrsteps (is a continuous variable that is the logarithm of a ratio, so we don\u2019t have problems of scale). We have on each treatment arm a different intervention. To predict the number of logrsteps of each individual we use machine learning and in particular a regression decision tree model for each arm using CART algorithm.

Glen VanHerck, commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command, said he was certain that the initial episode, the downing of a Chinese surveillance balloon off the U.S. East Coast on Feb. 4, \u201cwas clearly a balloon. These are objects. I\u2019m not able to categorize how they stay aloft.\u201d The general also declined to rule out any possibility, including whether the objects were extraterrestrial in origin.\n\nAfter the general\u2019s remarks, a Defense official who requested anonymity to speak about a developing situation said that there is \u201cno indication of aliens or extraterrestrial activity with these recent takedowns.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the Chinese balloon, said Melissa Dalton, assistant secretary of Defense for homeland defense and hemispheric affairs, \u201cwe had a basis and intelligence to know definitively that its point of origin was the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d No such certainty exists with the subsequent three objects.\n\nAfter the initial episode, NORAD shifted its approach to monitoring the airspace over North America, Dalton added. That effort involves \u201cmore closely scrutinizing our airspace \u2026 including enhancing our radar, which may at least partly explain the increase in objects that we\u2019ve detected over the past week,\u201d she said.\n\nThe latest object was first detected on Saturday at 4:45 p.m. over Canada. It entered U.S. airspace a short time later, eventually falling off the radar over Montana and reappearing over Wisconsin. By that time, U.S. F-16 and Canadian F-18 fighter planes were scrambled to intercept it. One F-16 knocked it down with a Sidewinder missile over Lake Huron, where it likely fell into Canadian waters, VanHerck said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden gave the order to take out the object based on the recommendations of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and military leadership, according to a Defense Department statement.\n\nAlthough military officials did not assess it to be a threat to anything on the ground, the object\u2019s path and altitude raised concerns, including that it could pose a risk to civil aviation, the officials said.\n\n\u201cToday, a high-altitude object was detected in U.S. airspace over Lake Huron. NORAD launched Canadian and U.S. aircraft to investigate and the object was taken down in U.S. airspace by U.S. aircraft,\u201d Canada\u2019s defense minister, Anita Anand, said in a statement. \u201cWe unequivocally support this action, and we\u2019ll continue to work with the U.S. and NORAD to protect North America.\u201d\n\nTwo U.S. House members from Michigan, Republican Rep. Jack Bergman and Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, confirmed earlier on Sunday that pilots from the Air Force and National Guard had taken out the object above Lake Huron.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know more about what this was in the coming days, but for now, be assured that all parties have been laser-focused on it from the moment it traversed our waters,\u201d Slotkin said on Twitter.

You may ask me clarifying questions about the narrative and themes of the story, though you should distinguish these questions from the story text. The story is set in the near future United States, in a store that sells android devices called \"artificial friends\", abbreviated AF. The story should be written in a first-person perspective from one of the AFs in the store. The narrator's name is Klara. Klara's goal is to be purchased by a human child. Klara, though an AF, speaks, thinks, and presents as 10 year old girl. Parents purchase AFs in the shop for their children, also roughly age 10. Klara is very polite and agreeable, both to others and in her own thoughts. Klara is solar powered, personifies the sun, and believes that the sun has special healing powers. Klara's belief in the healing power of the sun is based on her observations through the shop window that humans outside react positively to sunshine, and she herself is physically energized by the sun. Klara has not yet been outside when the story beings, though the story should conclude with a happy ending of Klara being purchased by a child and venturing outside happily. The source of dramatic tension in the story is whether or not Klara will be purchased. Children and parents often come into the store, interact with AFs, and do not purchase them. Klara, like other AFs, fears never being chosen for purchase, though she remains optimistic about this possibility throughout the story. The store is operated by a human, referred to by the AFs as Manager. Manager has warm regard for AFs in the store and acts as a caregiver, providing encouragement and instruction for how best to appear desirable for purchase by children and parents shopping in the store. A theme of the story is the moral ambiguity of offering apparently conscious android AFs for sale. Your first response should begin the story or ask a clarifying question about the story.

{"category": "creative_writing", "instruction": "write me a story about The Dead Frogman of Cardiff Docks\nQueen Alexandra Dock 1974\nShipping in the Queen Alexandra Dock 1974\nOne of the most significant criminal enquiries undertaken at Cardiff Docks was a case involving large quantities of drugs brought from the West Indies. It was a lengthy investigation that began with the death of a scuba diver whose body was recovered from the Queen Alexandra Dock.\n\nDuring March 1982, several anonymous telephone calls were received about a man alleged to have gone missing while using sub-aqua diving gear at the docks. Calls were made both to the South Wales Police and to the British Transport Police at the docks, initially by a female and later by a male. With each call, more details emerged- the man was described as West Indian and the location was given as the Queen Alexandra Dock.\n\nSearches by Police Underwater Search Teams did not find anything. Visibility in the dock was extremely poor and as they worked, huge conga eels slithered and scraped past the divers- it was not a pleasant experience in the inky blackness. When HMS Cardiff put into docks on a courtesy visit the opportunity was taken for a sonar sweep to be carried out. Once again nothing was found- what happens to a human body submerged in water depends on many things and the chances of finding one were minimal.\n\nHowever, some weeks after the calls began, two tugs were assisting a ship leaving the Queen Alexandra Dock and as they took up the tow their powerful screws churned up the water and a body was flushed to the surface. It was a body dressed in sub-aqua diving gear and was showing signs of having been in the water some time. At the mortuary, with the diving gear removed, it was found to be that of a West Indian male and all the circumstances suggested that this was the missing man. The heavy diving gear may also have been why the body had not surfaced earlier. A conference between senior officers of the South Wales and British Transport Police did not find agreement on whether the death should be regarded as suspicious.\n\nThe post mortem examination was carried out by eminent pathologist Professor Sir Bernard Knight, who found it difficult to establish the cause of death. But significantly, none of the tiny microbes known as diotodes, normally present in water, were found in the bone marrow possibly indicating the deceased did not die from drowning. There were also several interesting marks on the body, the significance of which would become apparent later. A square bruise was seen on the right side of the face and a similar one on the chest. There was also an unusual wide mark on the left wrist. One other piece of vital evidence came from examination of the diving equipment; the valve on the oxygen cylinder was closed, pointing to the fact that diving had been completed by the time the death occurred.\n\nDI Vic Miller began an investigation and looked for a connection with the West Indies. The shipping line Geest operated between South Wales and the West Indies and one of their boats- the MV Geestland had been diverted into Cardiff Docks a few weeks earlier, about the time the diver had gone missing. Crucially, it had unloaded its cargo of bananas on the north side of the Queens Dock, exactly where the body had been brought to the surface by the tug! The Geestland was brought back into Cardiff and dry docked and something very significant was quickly found. A length of chain was discovered hanging below the hull near the propeller. It was about 20 feet long and on the end was a shackle secured with a nut and bolt. That answered a question that had been puzzling the officers ever since the body had been found; an unexplained spanner had been discovered tied to the wet suit chest. When the spanner was matched to the shackle, they were an exact fit. And one of the Geestland\u2019s engineers told of hearing a strange metallic sound coming from the hull during the voyage from the West Indies. A picture was emerging and the police suspected that a container had been secured to the ship\u2019s hull before the vessel left the West Indies and was to be recovered when the ship arrived in the UK. The dead diver was apparently part of a well-organised drug running syndicate!\n\nFollowing a different line of enquiry, the man who had made the anonymous calls was traced and he identified the deceased as his friend- Peter Macdonald Jones. The dead man\u2019s mother told police that he had had a girlfriend known as \u2018The Duchess\u2019 who worked at a department store in Reading. At the store, a former employee was tracked to South Wales and enquiries at a store in Cardiff found that a new member of staff had recently been distressed; she had confided to a colleague that her boyfriend had died. Back in Reading, enquiries established that there were connections to some fairly undesirable people involved in the local drug scene.\n\nThe woman, known as \u2018The Duchess\u2019, was arrested and immediately lied about her identity. Realising she may have made a mistake she fell silent and remained that way throughout an initial interview. She was taken home for a search of her flat in Newport. At first, nothing incriminating was found nor was there anything to link her to Peter Jones or even to Reading. Seemingly, she was a woman without a past but as the search progressed, officers noticed that the only indication of any wealth in the flat were two original paintings by L.S. Lowery on the lounge wall. DI Miller examined the paintings and took the back off them. Between the canvas and the backboard of one was a photograph of Peter Jones and in the second was a photograph of her and Peter together. Here was the connection the police had been searching for.\n\nWith her boyfriend dead, The Duchess could see that she had nowhere else to go and her best option now was to help the police. Over time, DI Vic Miller established a rapport and her story was slowly unravelled; it proved to be a revealing story indeed. She had been set up in the flat by her boyfriend, Peter Jones, and his associate, James Timothy for the purpose of providing \u2018a safe house\u2019 for drug importation operations in South Wales. Jones was a married man and lived in Reading as did Timothy, who was believed to be heavily involved in the drugs underworld. Almost every month she would meet the two men and a canister of drugs would be recovered from a ship bringing bananas from the West Indies. She would fetch the drugs from the docks and drive them to an address in Reading, having been given a cover story in case she was stopped. The operation had been going on for nearly five years, and each consignment meant anything up to \u00a3500,000 in street value. It was understood that no-one involved in the drug trafficking should display any outward sign of wealth. Recently though, Peter Jones had begun to deviate from the rules and shortly before he died he had put down a \u00a35,000 deposit on a Porsche motor car. He had also purchased a plot of land in a residential area in Barbados and was having a bungalow built. It was not a wise move; Timothy had learned of the deposit on the car from an associate in Reading\n\nBoth Timothy and Jones were experienced divers and on that March night in 1982 they set out on one more drug recovery operation from beneath a ship. They were probably expecting the Geestland to be at Barry Docks but bad weather made Cardiff a preferred option. It was a foul night when The Duchess drove Peter Jones and James Timothy to Cardiff Docks- a gale was blowing and it was lashing with rain- in many respects perfect conditions to undertake their hazardous activity, safe from casual observation. The men changed into their diving gear and as usual it was arranged they would be dropped off by The Duchess who would return later to avoid having the car attract attention. Through the rain and the darkness, she watched them descend the steps into the uninviting water and then left; she would not see Peter Jones again.\n\nThe Duchess returned at the prearranged time but Timothy came back to the car alone. He had his diving kit but there was no sign of any drugs and he was vague and evasive about what had happened to Peter Jones. As they waited for around half an hour The Duchess became angry and began to panic, believing that Timothy had done something to him. Eventually, she drove Timothy to Newport, intending to go back and look for Jones in daylight. Timothy led her to believe that an argument had taken place about the drugs and that he had ended up hitting Jones with a lead diving belt and he had fallen back into the water. Timothy had returned to the car believing that Jones would get out alright, but obviously he had not. The Duchess made enquiries herself amongst other drug dealers to see if Jones had been heard of but she did not go as far as reporting her missing man to the police.\n\nWith the discovery of the body the investigation had intensified. One aspect concentrated on the enquiry to trace and interview Timothy, whilst others took on many of the other lines of enquiry including the Reading connection. Many long hours were spent as enquiries spread the length and breadth of the land. Officers learnt that both Peter Jones and James Timothy had contacts in the West Indies and had recently visited the islands. There was evidence that Timothy and Jones had been associates for ten years at least and both had bought diving equipment from the same shop in Falmouth five years previously.\n\nBy the middle of June, Timothy had been arrested, taken to Cardiff and interviewed at the BTP Divisional HQ. But throughout the interview he made no reply except to indicate he did not wish to answer questions. His reply was always the same and he never once lost his cool or became perturbed- he simply remained silent. Despite the serious allegations, Timothy was allowed bail and was interviewed on a further five or six occasions. The only variation from his veil of silence was an occasional stock answer- \u201cI have never murdered anyone in my life. I have the highest regard for human life.\u201d\n\nThe truth about the events that took place in the dark on the quayside at the Queen Alexandra Dock between Jones and Timothy has never been established. The police investigation had always been led with a murder or manslaughter charge in mind but although there was plenty of circumstantial evidence it was insufficient to bring a charge of homicide. No drugs were ever recovered by the police as a result of this incident, nor were any seen by The Duchess when she collected Timothy. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that there were no drugs there to be recovered. Had Jones or someone else intercepted the haul when the vessel was at an American port during its voyage? And if this was not the first consignment to go missing, was someone doing a bit of freelance work, in the USA perhaps? It may be significant that Jones\u2019 passport showed that he had recently returned to the UK from Barbados via Florida.\n\nJames Timothy was charged with conspiring with Peter Macdonald Jones and others to import controlled drugs at Cardiff Docks. He pleaded not guilty at Cardiff Crown Court but was convicted and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment. No person was ever charged in connection with the death of Peter Macdonald Jones, the dead frogman of Cardiff Docks.", "input": ""}

There were no other positions. I told the commander in chief to find the appropriate forces to help our guys in Bakhmut.\"\n\nThe comments followed a report by the German newspaper Bild quoting Ukrainian government sources that armed forces commander Valery Zaluzhny had disagreed with Mr Zelensky about the operation several weeks ago, recommending a retreat from the city.\n\nMost defenders shared Gen Zaluzhny's view, the paper added.\n\nAnd at the weekend the US-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Ukrainian troops were probably conducting a \"limited fighting withdrawal\" while \"continuing to inflict high casualties\" on the Russians.\n\nGround forces commander Olexandr Syrsky, quoted on a visit to the front line on Sunday by Ukrainska Pravda newspaper, said the fighting in Bakhmut had reached the \"highest level of tension\".\n\n\"The enemy has been throwing extra Wagner forces into the battle,\" he said. \"Our troops have been courageously defending our positions in the north of Bakhmut, trying to prevent the encirclement of the city.\"\n###\n \n \n \n \uc9c0\uae08 \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\uae30", "input": ""}

Here are some arguments for both perspectives:\n\nReasonable:\n\nInherent curiosity: Human beings are naturally curious, constantly asking questions about the world around them and seeking meaning in their lives. Philosophy is fundamentally about asking and exploring such questions. In this sense, everyone can be considered a philosopher as they engage in critical thinking and attempt to understand the world.\n\nEveryday philosophical discussions: People often engage in conversations and debates about moral, ethical, and existential topics. These discussions, even if informal, reflect philosophical inquiry and can indicate that everyone is, to some extent, a philosopher.\n\nPersonal worldview: Everyone has a unique perspective on life, informed by their experiences, beliefs, and values. This personal worldview could be seen as a philosophical stance, making everyone a philosopher by default.\n\nUnreasonable:\n\nLack of formal education: Professional philosophers typically have extensive formal education in the field, which provides them with a deep understanding of philosophical theories, concepts, and methodologies. Most people lack this formal training, and therefore might not be considered philosophers in the traditional sense.\n\nIncomplete knowledge: Philosophy is a vast and complex discipline, encompassing various branches such as ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, and more. Not everyone has a comprehensive understanding of these fields, which might limit their ability to engage in informed philosophical discussions.\n\nSuperficial engagement: While it is true that people may engage in philosophical discussions, many may not delve deeply into the subject matter, nor critically assess their own beliefs or those of others. Such superficial engagement may not qualify someone as a philosopher.\n\nIn conclusion, whether or not everyone is a philosopher depends on how one defines a philosopher and the expectations associated with that label. If we consider philosophy as the natural curiosity and basic questioning of life, it is reasonable to say that everyone is a philosopher. However, if we define a philosopher as someone with extensive knowledge and formal education in the field, then the idea becomes less reasonable.", "input": ""}

The five stages are:\n\nDenial: In the initial stage of grief, a person may have difficulty accepting the loss. Denial serves as a coping mechanism, allowing the individual to slowly come to terms with the reality of the situation. It can provide a temporary respite from the overwhelming emotions associated with loss.\n\nAnger: As the reality of the loss sets in, a person may experience anger or resentment. This anger can be directed towards themselves, others, or even the person who has passed away. This stage often occurs as the grieving individual struggles to make sense of the situation and searches for someone or something to blame for their pain.\n\nBargaining: In this stage, the person may attempt to regain control of their situation by making deals with a higher power or their own conscience. They may have thoughts like, \"If only I had done this, they would still be here.\" Bargaining is a way for the individual to process their guilt and find ways to alleviate their emotional pain.\n\nDepression: As the full weight of the loss becomes more apparent, a person may experience deep sadness, despair, and hopelessness. This stage can manifest itself through symptoms such as loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping, and social withdrawal. Depression is a natural response to the immense pain of losing a loved one, and it may take time for the individual to work through their feelings.\n\nAcceptance: Eventually, a person may reach a stage of acceptance, where they are able to acknowledge the reality of their loss and begin to move forward with their life. This stage does not necessarily mean that the person is \"over\" their grief, but rather that they have learned to live with it and integrate it into their life. Acceptance allows the individual to find new meaning and build a new life without the presence of their loved one.\n\nIt is essential to note that people grieve in different ways, and the experience of these stages may vary significantly between individuals. Some may not experience all the stages, while others may go through them in a different order or revisit certain stages multiple times. The grieving process is unique to each person and should be approached with patience, understanding, and support.", "input": ""}

a very Hands-On owner he's been\n\n0:35\nformulating Twitter policy in real time\n\n0:38\nBanning accounts bringing back accounts\n\n0:39\ndoing everything by Twitter Paul over\n\n0:41\nthe weekend Elon Musk put out a poll\n\n0:43\nasking whether he should step down as\n\n0:45\nthe active head of Twitter this doesn't\n\n0:47\nmean he'll give up ownership of Twitter\n\n0:48\nof course but he put out a poll saying\n\n0:50\nthat he would pledge it to abide by the\n\n0:52\nresults of the poll and asking whether\n\n0:54\npeople should allow him to remain the\n\n0:57\nCEO of Twitter\n\n0:58\nand then the poll results came in and\n\n1:01\nnearly 60 of people on Twitter were\n\n1:04\npulled said that musk should not Remain\n\n1:06\nthe CEO of Twitter now here's the thing\n\n1:08\nI think musk is smart enough to know\n\n1:09\nwhat the result was going to be ahead of\n\n1:11\ntime I really doubt that he thought that\n\n1:13\n60 people are going to say yeah so what\n\n1:14\nthis really looks more like is a\n\n1:16\ntransition plan he's he wants to make it\n\n1:18\nlook like the people wanted him to step\n\n1:19\nout of the way and then he'll appoint\n\n1:20\nsomebody else to run Twitter but this\n\n1:22\ndoes speak to the way that Twitter is\n\n1:24\ncurrently being run which is very ad hoc\n\n1:26\nagain I don't have a problem with that\n\n1:27\nbecause I would rather that there'd be\n\n1:29\nsomeone at the top of the food chain to\n\n1:30\nblame as opposed to the way Twitter was\n\n1:32\nbeing run but this does throw the entire\n\n1:34\nsocial media system into at least some\n\n1:37\nchaos because nobody actually knows\n\n1:38\nwhat's coming next I have no information\n\n1:40\nsuggesting that Elon Musk actually knows\n\n1:42\nwho would replace him as CEO of Twitter\n\n1:43\nSonic he has somebody waiting in the\n\n1:45\nwings and this is all a setup this is\n\n1:47\nall seat of the pants kind of stuff\n\n1:48\nwhich makes it on the one hand fun and\n\n1:49\non the other hand slightly terrifying\n\n1:51\nfor actually I'm trying to figure out\n\n1:53\nwhat standards Twitter is attempting to\n\n1:56\napply here according to the Wall Street\n\n1:57\nJournal the majority of Twitter uter\n\n1:59\nusers said Elon Musk should step down as\n\n2:01\nchief of the company in a poll the\n\n2:02\nbillionaire pledged to follow casting to\n\n2:04\nuncertainty on the social media platform\n\n2:05\nafter more than seven weeks of turmoil\n\n2:06\nsince he took it over more than 17\n\n2:08\nmillion users had voted by the time the\n\n2:09\npoll on the platform closed after 6 a.m\n\n2:11\neastern time with 57.5 saying he should\n\n2:14\nleave as the head of the company he\n\n2:15\nbought in October for 44 billion dollars\n\n2:17\nmusket said when he launched the Twitter\n\n2:19\npoll on Sunday he would abide by the\n\n2:20\nresults it's not clear who would be\n\n2:22\ntaking over Twitter Inc if musk steps\n\n2:23\naside or what his role would remain\n\n2:25\ngiven that he still owns the company\n\n2:26\nmost of the company's prior leadership\n\n2:27\nwas either fired or left after he took\n\n2:29\nover and by the way it's not going to be\n\n2:30\na great job for all those people who are\n\n2:31\nclamoring and saying out there oh I\n\n2:33\ncould do it well musk is just going to\n\n2:35\nfire you after two weeks because all\n\n2:37\nthat will mean is that he stands sort of\n\n2:39\nbehind whoever the Twitter CEO is musk\n\n2:42\ntweeted quote no one wants the job who\n\n2:44\ncan actually keep Twitter alive there is\n\n2:45\nno successor\n\n2:47\nnow one of the reasons why muskie's\n\n2:49\ndoing this is because his other\n\n2:50\ncompanies like SpaceX and Tesla have\n\n2:52\nbeen suffering on the stock market\n\n2:53\nshares and Tesla have fallen more than\n\n2:55\n57 this year frustrating some retail\n\n2:57\ninvestors who partly blame it musk's\n\n2:59\nfocus on Twitter for the decline and\n\n3:01\nthis is not unusual anytime the market\n\n3:03\nperceives musk as a volatile figure his\n\n3:05\nstock drops and then it always comes\n\n3:06\nback this happened with Tesla when musk\n\n3:08\nwent on Joe Rogan's show and he smoked\n\n3:09\npot and for a moment there it looked\n\n3:11\nlike the Tesla stock was going to be in\n\n3:13\nrough shape and then of course Tesla\n\n3:15\npulled out of the tailspin and soon it\n\n3:17\nwas doing fine\n\n3:18\nTesla shares were jumping pre-market\n\n3:20\nMonday amid the suggestion the musk\n\n3:21\nwould stop running Twitter and return\n\n3:22\nhis attention back to the engineering\n\n3:23\ncompany that he founded there have been\n\n3:25\nquestions since musk first showed\n\n3:26\ninterest in buying Twitter how he would\n\n3:27\njuggle running that company while also\n\n3:29\npursuing all of his other endeavors Bill\n\n3:31\nNelson the National Aeronautics and\n\n3:32\nSpace administration's administrator\n\n3:34\nthis month said he had asked SpaceX\n\n3:35\npresident when Shotwell if Twitter would\n\n3:37\ndivert from the rocket company's Mission\n\n3:38\nshe assured me would not be a\n\n3:40\ndistraction musk said last month that he\n\n3:42\nhad too much work on his plate\n\n3:44\nnow again it's been a pretty chaotic\n\n3:46\ncouple of months under musk much of what\n\n3:49\nhe has done has been excellent so for\n\n3:50\nexample the breaking of new Twitter\n\n3:52\nfiles demonstrating what exactly Twitter\n\n3:54\nwas doing to shut down free speech\n\n3:55\nbefore musk took over musket said that\n\n3:58\nhe was essentially a free speech\n\n3:59\nlibertarian when he took over and then\n\n4:00\nhe's sort of activated in as I say an ad\n\n4:03\nhoc policy where he bans people and then\n\n4:04\nhe brings them back based on Twitter\n\n4:06\npolls where the standards are not\n\n4:07\nentirely clear and what's funny to me\n\n4:08\nabout that is that the entire media are\n\n4:10\ncaterwalling about this they're\n\n4:11\nscreaming to the heavens screaming to\n\n4:13\nGod about why exactly the standards are\n\n4:15\nso opaque and changeable it's like\n\n4:17\nwelcome to the party pal it's been like\n\n4:19\nthis for the last 10 years the only\n\n4:20\ndifference that this time you guys are\n\n4:22\nsometimes getting clocked but the real\n\n4:24\nthing that musk has done here is of\n\n4:25\ncourse revealed what was going on at\n\n4:27\nTwitter during the Trump era we'll get\n\n4:29\nto more of this in just one

week\n\n6:40\nformer Rolling Stone journalist he\n\n6:42\nrevealed how much\n\n6:44\ncontact was had between the higher ups\n\n6:46\nat Twitter and the FBI and they should\n\n6:48\nscare everybody when the FBI is\n\n6:50\ncontacting social media companies and\n\n6:51\ntelling them what to put up and what to\n\n6:52\ntake down and all the rest of it\n\n6:54\npredicated not on typical sort of law\n\n6:56\nenforcement procedures not based on\n\n6:59\nwarrants not based on investigations but\n\n7:01\nbased on simply the FBI sense they don't\n\n7:02\nwant something up that's pretty scary\n\n7:04\nstuff Tybee posted late on Friday\n\n7:07\nafternoon the Twitter files are\n\n7:08\nrevealing more every day about how the\n\n7:09\ngovernment collects analyzes and flags\n\n7:11\nor social media content Twitter's\n\n7:13\ncontent with the FBI contact with the\n\n7:14\nFBI was constant and pervasive as if it\n\n7:17\nwere a subsidiary between January 2020\n\n7:19\nand November 2022 there were over 150\n\n7:21\nemails between the FBI and former\n\n7:23\nTwitter trust and safety Chief Joel Roth\n\n7:25\nsome are mundane like San Francisco\n\n7:27\nagent Elvis Chen wishing Roth a happy\n\n7:28\nNew Year along with a reminder to attend\n\n7:30\nour quarterly call next week others our\n\n7:32\nrequest for information into Twitter\n\n7:33\nusers related to active investigations\n\n7:34\nbut a surprisingly High number our\n\n7:36\nrequest by the FBI for Twitter to take\n\n7:38\naction on Election misinformation even\n\n7:40\ninvolving joke tweets from low follower\n\n7:42\naccounts the FBI's social media focused\n\n7:44\ntask force known as ftif created in the\n\n7:47\nwake of the 2016 election swelled to 80\n\n7:49\nagents and corresponded with Twitter to\n\n7:51\nidentify alleged foreign influence in\n\n7:52\nelection tampering of all kinds Federal\n\n7:53\nintelligence and law enforcement reach\n\n7:55\ninto Twitter included the Department of\n\n7:57\nHomeland Security which partnered with\n\n7:58\nsecurity contractors and think tanks to\n\n8:00\npressure Twitter to moderate content\n\n8:02\nreports it's no secret the government\n\n8:04\nanalyzes bulk data for all sorts of\n\n8:06\npurposes but the Twitter file shows\n\n8:08\nsomething new agencies like the FBI and\n\n8:09\nDHS regularly sending social media\n\n8:11\ncontent to Twitter through multiple\n\n8:13\nentry points pre-flagged for moderation\n\n8:15\nwhat stands out is the sheer quantity of\n\n8:16\nreports from the government some are\n\n8:18\naggregated from public hotlines there's\n\n8:20\nan unanswered question do agencies like\n\n8:22\nthe FBI and DHS do in-house flagging\n\n8:24\nwork themselves or are they farming it\n\n8:25\nout one Former Intelligence officer said\n\n8:27\nyou have to prove to me that inside the\n\n8:29\neffing government you can do any kind of\n\n8:30\nmassive data or AI search\n\n8:33\ntaibi says there is a master canine\n\n8:35\nquality to the FBI's relationship to\n\n8:37\nTwitter there's a November 2022 email\n\n8:39\nfor example in which the FBI San\n\n8:41\nFrancisco notifieds whether it wanted\n\n8:43\naction on four specific accounts\n\n8:46\nTwitter Personnel in that case went on\n\n8:48\nto look for reasons to suspend all four\n\n8:49\naccounts\n\n8:51\njust to show that the FBI can be hyper\n\n8:52\nintrusive in both directions they also\n\n8:54\nasked Twitter to review a blue laning\n\n8:55\naccount for a different joke except here\n\n8:56\nit was more obvious that the person who\n\n8:59\nkids a lot was actually kidding\n\n9:01\npretty much all of the right-wing\n\n9:03\naccounts ended up being suspended by\n\n9:04\nTwitter at the behest of the FBI now\n\n9:07\nthis of course is pretty scary stuff\n\n9:09\nyou don't really want the FBI\n\n9:12\ncoordinating with the social media\n\n9:13\ncompanies to determine what should be\n\n9:14\ntaken down what should be left up\n\n9:17\nmany of the accounts that the FBI was\n\n9:18\ntargeting were satirical in nature\n\n9:21\nmany of them were relatively low\n\n9:22\nengagement and some were suspended most\n\n9:24\nwith the generic thanks Twitter letter\n\n9:27\nwhen told of the FBI flagging one of the\n\n9:29\npeople's suspended said my thoughts\n\n9:31\ninitially were seems like primi facie\n\n9:33\nwon a First Amendment violation holy cow\n\n9:35\nme and account with the reach of namiba\n\n9:37\n3 what else are they looking at I can't\n\n9:38\nbelieve the FBI is policing jokes on\n\n9:40\nTwitter that's craziest in one of the\n\n9:41\nusers but that's exactly what was\n\n9:43\nhappening\n\n9:44\nand this is one of the reasons why it\n\n9:45\nwas important for must to take over\n\n9:47\nbecause musk is revealing all of the bad\n\n9:49\nactivity of the government in cahoots\n\n9:51\nwith Twitter\n\n9:52\nnow at the same time as I say the musk's\n\n9:55\nrunning of Twitter has been\n\n9:57\nextraordinarily ad hoc I've used that\n\n9:59\nphrase a bunch of times he's just doing\n\n10:01\nit sort of seat of the pans so for\n\n10:03\nexample he suspended Taylor Lorenz\n\n10:05\nTaylor Lorenz is just a garbage shooter\n\n10:07\nreporter over at the Washington Post she\n\n10:08\nspends all day just irritating people on\n\n10:10\nsocial media and then tracking down her\n\n10:12\nenemies on social media and in the case\n\n10:13\nof Libs of tick tock actually doxing\n\n10:15\npeople on social media well she was\n\n10:17\nactually briefly suspended from Twitter\n\n10:19\nover the weekend she acted as though she\n\n10:20\nhad been shipped to the gulags under\n\n10:23\nStalin or something she was back on\n\n10:25\nsocial media talking about her\n\n10:26\ntremendously difficult\n\n10:28\nperiod of Twitter expulsion\n\n10:31\nin in pretty short order\n\n10:33\nbut um she uh\n\n10:36\nyeah she came back online by the way and\n\n10:38\nthen she was sharing memes and all this\n\n10:39\nbut she was suspended because of doxing\n\n10:41\nof Libs attack now that's not a good\n\n10:42\nstandard I think Taylor Lorenz is\n\n10:44\ngarbage and I think there are many times\n\n10:45\nwhere she does things that ought to get\n\n10:46\nher suspended or expelled from Twitter\n\n10:47\nincluding docs and people like Libs of\n\n10:49\ntick tock however\n\n10:51\nTaylor Lorenz you can't retroactively\n\n10:53\ndecide to suspend people\n\n10:55\nhe can't decide two years later because\n\n10:56\nTaylor runs did something to Libs of\n\n10:58\ntick tock that that now she ought to be\n\n10:59\nsuspended because otherwise there's no\n\n11:01\nstandard at all\n\n11:03\nuh I I will say it was pretty funny\n\n11:05\nTaylor Lorenz found out she'd been\n\n11:06\nsuspended she obviously was pretty happy\n\n11:07\nabout it and then she ended up dropping\n\n11:09\noff of her own Instagram feed she had an\n\n11:11\nInstagram feed when she was announced or\n\n11:12\nher Tick Tock feed when she was\n\n11:13\nannouncing this and all of the all of\n\n11:15\nthe comments on The Tick Tock feed were\n\n11:17\nabout how much people hated Taylor\n\n11:18\nlorenze away here's what it sounded like\n\n11:23\num\n\n11:24\noh my God this is just a bunch of Elon\n\n11:27\nfans\n\n11:30\nall right\n\n11:32\nOh Aaron Space Museum hi\n\n11:35\num guys I did have only three tweets\n\n11:38\nbecause my tweets Auto delete and they\n\n11:40\nhave since 2014.\n\n11:42\nanyway I do have to go\n\n11:46\num but I love you guys and it was so fun\n\n11:47\nto get to chat with you\n\n11:51\nwhat's up see you later Taylor we'll\n\n11:53\ncatch you later but okay Taylor Lorenz\n\n11:55\nended up being reinstated here's the\n\n11:56\nbottom one bottom line is this whoever\n\n11:58\nis going to come in four months because\n\n11:59\nnow he's pledged he's going to step\n\n12:00\naside and he's going to put in some sort\n\n12:02\nof new CEO here is the standard that\n\n12:04\nought to be applied the standard that\n\n12:05\nought to be applied is a pure First\n\n12:07\nAmendment Free Speech standard that's\n\n12:09\nwhat ought to happen\n\n12:10\nand then all other standard talks to be\n\n12:12\nmade transparent if you're going to\n\n12:13\ndowngrade tweets that are First\n\n12:15\nAmendment protected but you don't want\n\n12:16\ngetting wide dissemination you should\n\n12:18\nhave a transparent process whereby\n\n12:20\npeople can quickly see why the thing is\n\n12:22\nbeing downgraded I will say that that\n\n12:24\nmusk has been radically transparent even\n\n12:25\nthough he is doing things he did the\n\n12:27\npants he's being very transparent about\n\n12:28\nwhy he is doing things and how he is\n\n12:30\ndoing things and the answer is he's\n\n12:31\ndoing because he feels like it whoever\n\n12:33\ncomes in next should continue that\n\n12:34\npolicy of radical transparency but\n\n12:36\nshould take a very strict First\n\n12:37\nAmendment standard with regard to\n\n12:38\nTwitter in the United States one of the\n\n12:40\nbig problems for international companies\n\n12:41\nlike Twitter is that the Free Speech\n\n12:43\nstandards in the United States are not\n\n12:44\nthe Free Speech standards that apply in\n\n12:45\nsay France or Britain or actual\n\n12:47\nquote-unquote hate speech can be\n\n12:49\nprosecuted they don't have the same\n\n12:50\nFirst Amendment standards over in Europe\n\n12:52\nso the best that Twitter probably can do\n\n12:54\nrealistically speaking is promulgate\n\n12:56\nstandards that are allowed by various\n\n12:58\ngovernments in various parts of the West\n\n13:00\nthat's the best that they are going to\n\n13:01\ndo\n\n13:02\nwhoever comes in next however you can\n\n13:04\nimagine that that musk is not going to\n\n13:05\ngive up complete control of Twitter he's\n\n13:07\njust going to go up day-to-day control\n\n13:08\nwhich will allow him to go back to his\n\n13:09\ncompanies this is not a big victory\n\n13:11\nagainst Elon Musk the way the media are\n\n13:12\nportraying it he still owns the place\n\n13:14\nand despite all of the best attempts of\n\n13:16\nthe media to try to cudgel Twitter back\n\n13:17\ninto what it was before that is not\n\n13:19\ngoing to happen Okay meanwhile we have a\n\n13:21\ncrisis that has now been Unleashed on\n\n13:23\nour Southern border is going to get a\n\n13:25\nlot worse according to the Washington\n\n13:26\nPost both Republicans and Democrats are\n\n13:28\nwarning there could soon be an\n\n13:29\nunmanageable influx of migrants at the\n\n13:31\nsouthern border of the United States\n\n13:32\nwith the expected end this week of title\n\n13:34\n42 a trump era immigration policy that\n\n13:36\nallowed border agents to expel migrants\n\n13:38\nfor public health reasons during the\n\n13:39\ncoveted pandemic on ABC's this week\n\n13:41\nTexas governor Greg Abbott warned if the\n\n13:43\ncourts did not intervene keep title 42\n\n13:45\nin place it would be total chaos at the\n\n13:47\nsouthern border a federal appellate\n\n13:48\ncourt on Friday ruled the bite\n\n13:49\nAdministration could end title 42 on\n\n13:51\nWednesday unless the Supreme Court\n\n13:52\nintervenes Republican officials have\n\n13:54\nsignals in court records it would appeal\n\n13:55\nthe decision to the Supreme Court how\n\n13:57\nbad is this it's so bad the El Paso\n\n13:59\nmayor Oscar Lisa actually declared a\n\n14:01\nstate of emergency in El ASO ahead of\n\n14:03\ntitle 42's expiration setting an\n\n14:05\nincreased number of Asylum Seekers\n\n14:06\nsleeping in the streets there was the\n\n14:08\nmayor of el tasigan as a Democrat\n\n14:09\ndeclaring state of emergency so does\n\n14:11\nthis is this all ginned up by the\n\n14:12\nRepublican leaning press or is there a\n\n14:14\nreal crisis at the border\n\n14:16\nas we see the increase in Asylum Seeker\n\n14:19\nsent to our community and we see the\n\n14:21\ntemperatures dropping and we know that\n\n14:24\ntitle 42 low stock hits going to be\n\n14:28\ncalled back on\n\n14:29\nWednesday we felt there was proper time\n\n14:32\ntoday to call a state of emergency I\n\n14:35\nsaid from the beginning that I would\n\n14:37\ncall it when I felt that either our\n\n14:40\nAsylum Seekers for our community was not\n\n14:43\nsafe and I really believe that today our\n\n14:45\nAsylum Seekers are not safe\n\n14:49\nokay so he's thinking about the Asylum\n\n14:51\nSeekers that they're coming in and\n\n14:52\nthey're not safe well I mean the reality\n\n14:53\nis that the country is not safe when you\n\n14:55\nhave literally millions of people who\n\n14:58\nare crossing the border and you're not\n\n14:59\nvetting any of them\n\n15:00\nand yes you feel bad for people who\n\n15:02\nlegitimately are seeking Asylum and then\n\n15:04\nare tossed into a completely unworkable\n\n15:06\nsystem but the vast majority of people\n\n15:07\nwho are crossing our border are not\n\n15:08\ntechnical Asylum Seekers the people who\n\n15:11\nare crossing our border largely are\n\n15:12\neconomic migrants people who are coming\n\n15:14\nfrom countries that have worse economies\n\n15:15\nthan the United States I don't blame\n\n15:16\nthem but the people who are coming\n\n15:17\nacross the border are not people who\n\n15:19\nwould fit under our normal definition of\n\n15:21\npeople who ought to be receiving asylum\n\n15:23\nin the United States for human rights\n\n15:24\nreasons how bad are things about to get\n\n15:26\nLisa said he had spoken to Federal\n\n15:27\nofficials who said they believed El Paso\n\n15:29\ncould see four to six thousand new\n\n15:31\nmigrants on Wednesday alone\n\n15:33\nfour to six thousand new migrants on\n\n15:35\nWednesday alone that is an insane number\n\n15:37\nof people that is when title 42 expires\n\n15:39\nthat is a jump from the more than 2 000\n\n15:41\nmigrants the El Paso sector of U.S\n\n15:43\nCustoms and Border Protection is\n\n15:44\ncurrently getting every single day which\n\n15:46\nAgain by the way is an enormous number\n\n15:48\nof migrants\n\n15:49\nand that is just the El Paso sector that\n\n15:52\nis hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\n\n15:53\nthousands of people who are crossing the\n\n15:55\nsouthern border before title 42 is\n\n15:57\nrepealed one title 42 goes away you're\n\n16:00\ngoing to see a vast wash of people\n\n16:01\ncoming into the United States in fact\n\n16:03\nthe Washington people into the United\n\n16:04\nStates can be so broad that New York\n\n16:06\nCity is now fretting that there is the\n\n16:07\npossibility that a thousand migrants a\n\n16:09\nday could be entering New York City\n\n16:10\nremember that time when it was\n\n16:11\nabsolutely terrible that Greg Abbott was\n\n16:13\nsending some of the migrants who had\n\n16:15\nintroduced some of the illegal\n\n16:16\nimmigrants who had entered Texas over to\n\n16:17\nNew York and who's sending like a few\n\n16:18\ndozen people get ready for a thousand\n\n16:20\npeople arriving in New York City maybe\n\n16:22\nevery day according to Mayor Eric Adams\n\n16:24\nover in New York City\n\n16:26\nlast week Governor Gavin California\n\n16:27\ngovernor Gavin Newsom visited an\n\n16:29\nImmigration Center along the border and\n\n16:30\nsaid it was a federal government issue\n\n16:32\nthat similar immigration sites were\n\n16:33\nalready at capacity\n\n16:35\nSenator Alex Padilla of California\n\n16:36\ndefended the removal of title 42 saying\n\n16:38\nit was not intended to be an immigration\n\n16:39\npolicy but Public Health policy he said\n\n16:42\nwe're in a different place when it comes\n\n16:43\nto covet today than we were two or three\n\n16:44\nyears ago it's past time for title 42 to\n\n16:46\nbe gone\n\n16:48\nbut again there is no replacement policy\n\n16:50\nfor the Democratic party and for the Joe\n\n16:52\nBiden Administration\n\n16:54\nWhite House Press Secretary Kareem\n\n16:55\nJean-Pierre said last week that the bite\n\n16:57\nAdministration was prepared to lift\n\n16:58\ntitle 42 in quote unquote a safe and\n\n17:00\nhumane way but they do not actually have\n\n17:02\nthe means to do so and everybody knows\n\n17:05\nit including the Democrats by the way\n\n17:07\nnow everybody knows what's Happening\n\n17:08\nHere What's Happening Here is that the\n\n17:11\nBiden Administration has decided that\n\n17:12\nthey have effectively an open border\n\n17:14\npolicy informatically understand the\n\n17:15\nBorder they've rejected Donald Trump's\n\n17:17\nremain in Mexico policy which was state\n\n17:19\nin Mexico while you apply for asylum in\n\n17:21\nthe United States\n\n17:23\nthey've decided that they're not going\n\n17:24\nto vastly bulk up the number of border\n\n17:27\npatrol agents who are available\n\n17:29\nthey've decided that they are not even\n\n17:30\ngoing to vastly bulk up the number of\n\n17:32\ncourts that are available to process the\n\n17:34\npeople who are arriving on the border\n\n17:36\nthe Biden Administration has very little\n\n17:37\ninterest in actually stopping what's\n\n17:40\ngoing on at the border they have an\n\n17:41\ninterest in stopping people from\n\n17:42\ncovering it and this is why you have\n\n17:43\nBill malugan who actually has Drone\n\n17:45\nfootage of thousands of migrants\n\n17:46\ncrossing the Rio Grande then all of a\n\n17:48\nsudden the bite Administration gets very\n\n17:49\nangry they don't like being covered on\n\n17:50\nthis stuff\n\n17:52\nbut they have no problem with the actual\n\n17:54\nfundamental policy\n\n17:55\nand to the to the migrants who are\n\n17:57\ncrossing the border they understand\n\n17:58\nwhat's going on they're coming because\n\n17:59\nJoe Biden is President it's that simple\n\n18:01\none migrant is interviewed by CNN says\n\n18:04\nthe border border agents are telling him\n\n18:05\nto wait until 4 title 42 ends to cross\n\n18:08\nthe border well again the reason border\n\n18:10\npatrol is saying that is because that is\n\n18:11\nBiden Administration policy bind\n\n18:14\nAdministration policies title 42 means I\n\n18:15\nhave to turn you away when title 42\n\n18:17\nwhich is Coveted policy saying that you\n\n18:18\nmight have covid so we can just turn you\n\n18:19\naway for public health reasons when that\n\n18:21\ngoes away then you can come back you can\n\n18:22\napply normally which means a flood of\n\n18:24\npeople to the Border here's a migrant\n\n18:25\ninterviewed by CNN the reporter explains\n\n18:29\nGustavo what are you seeing there not\n\n18:32\nonly are these people getting in we have\n\n18:34\nall these people pondering when to pass\n\n18:37\nmost of them I've been talking to they\n\n18:40\nare from Venezuela they are telling me\n\n18:42\nthat some of them already tried to go in\n\n18:45\nsome of them are saying that once they\n\n18:48\nget there the agent tells them that this\n\n18:50\nis not the right time is\n\n19:02\nI would have a chance to answer because\n\n19:04\nChannel 42 would go away\n\n19:06\neverybody knows what's going on here\n\n19:07\neven the former DHS secretary Jay\n\n19:09\nJohnson right under Barack Obama he says\n\n19:12\nmigrants know that they can simply game\n\n19:13\nthe Asylum walls they can show up they\n\n19:15\ncan be processed they can jump from one\n\n19:17\ncourt appearance and they can disappear\n\n19:18\ninto the interior waiting for somebody\n\n19:19\nto amnesty them which is probably what\n\n19:21\nwill happen\n\n19:23\nthese people are going to be here for\n\n19:25\nyears because the Asylum claims that the\n\n19:28\nimmigration claims take years to go\n\n19:30\nthrough because the system is so\n\n19:31\noverwhelmed how does this get fixed\n\n19:36\nwell Anderson\n\n19:37\num first of all the courts have gotten\n\n19:41\nway too involved in what traditionally\n\n19:43\nhas been an area where the courts defer\n\n19:45\nto the political branches of government\n\n19:47\nto the point where our policy is muddled\n\n19:50\nand confusing one week it's no you have\n\n19:52\nto end title 42 another week it's no you\n\n19:54\nhave to keep it clearly the state of our\n\n19:57\nAsylum system and our laws is one of the\n\n20:01\nreasons that migrants come here\n\n20:05\noh really I mean if only you had been\n\n20:07\nthe Department of Homeland Security head\n\n20:09\nunder Barack Obama and you'd actually\n\n20:10\nchange the state of the laws and made it\n\n20:12\nclear that people should not come here\n\n20:13\nunless they have a legit Asylum claim if\n\n20:15\nonly you had done something about that\n\n20:16\noh well well Tom Cotton the senator from\n\n20:19\nArkansas quite correctly says our border\n\n20:21\nis wide open which of course is true\n\n20:22\nhere's the center from Arkansas\n\n20:26\ndo you continue to maintain that the\n\n20:28\nborder is secure\n\n20:30\nyes and we are working day in and day\n\n20:33\nout to enhance its security Congressman\n\n20:36\nfirst of all what's your reaction when\n\n20:38\nyou hear my orcas denying the words that\n\n20:40\nand we have more tape but it's only an\n\n20:41\nhour show\n\n20:44\nyeah Harris uh those are the words of a\n\n20:48\ndelusional ideologue of course our\n\n20:50\nborder is wide open since Joe Biden took\n\n20:52\noffice more than five million illegal\n\n20:55\naliens have entered our country\n\n20:59\nI mean that's an insane statistic we had\n\n21:01\ntomorrow on this in just one second\n\n21:02\nfirst the situation Ukraine it's getting\n\n21:04\nworse and worse the winter is Now\n\n21:05\nsetting in Russia continues to send\n\n21:07\nextraordinary amounts of ordinance

b-o-l-l-a-n-d\n\n23:06\nbranch.com promo code Shapiro so how\n\n23:10\ndoes the White House response the White\n\n23:11\nHouse responds in two ways one they\n\n23:13\npretend everything is hunky-dory and two\n\n23:15\nthey activate the media to pretend that\n\n23:17\nyou noticing is the problem so over the\n\n23:20\nweekend the White House said that ending\n\n23:21\ntitle 42 does not mean that the border\n\n23:23\nis wide open the border is still shut\n\n23:25\neverything is secure everything is good\n\n23:26\nhere's Fox news reporting\n\n23:28\nnow the White House were reacting last\n\n23:30\nnight to this ruling in a statement\n\n23:32\nsaying quote\n\n23:33\nto be clear the lifting of the title 42\n\n23:35\nPublic Health order does not mean the\n\n23:37\nborders open anyone who suggests\n\n23:39\notherwise is doing the work of Smugglers\n\n23:42\nspreading misinformation to make a quick\n\n23:44\nBuck off of vulnerable migrants despite\n\n23:47\nthe White House pointing the finger at\n\n23:48\nRepublicans some Democrats are directly\n\n23:50\ncontradicting the White House warning of\n\n23:52\nwhat they say will be a tidal wave of\n\n23:54\nillegal migrants expected to come to the\n\n23:56\nU.S on top of the more than 2 million in\n\n23:58\nthe past year\n\n24:00\nthe gall of these people so 5 million\n\n24:02\npeople have entered the country\n\n24:03\nillegally since Joe Biden took office\n\n24:04\nand if you notice it it's it's you\n\n24:07\nthat's the problem so it's us saying the\n\n24:09\nborder is open under Joe Biden that's\n\n24:10\ncausing people to come up and try to\n\n24:12\ncross the border it's not the Border\n\n24:14\nactually being open it's that they are\n\n24:15\nmisinformed all those people that that's\n\n24:17\nthe real problem so Martha raddatz doing\n\n24:19\nthe work of the Legacy Media which is\n\n24:21\nessentially just the praetorian guard\n\n24:23\nfor the Democratic party Martha\n\n24:24\nraditzova at ABC News she was talking to\n\n24:26\nTexas governor Greg Abbott and Abbott\n\n24:28\nwas saying Joe Biden is leaving the\n\n24:29\nboard open she's like well Joe Biden\n\n24:30\nsays he's not leaving the Border open\n\n24:31\nyou're saying he's leaving the Border\n\n24:33\nopen so it's your fault if you wouldn't\n\n24:34\nif you weren't out there saying that Joe\n\n24:36\nBiden was leaving the Border open no one\n\n24:37\nwould know it would be a big secret and\n\n24:39\nthen the Border wouldn't be open\n\n24:41\nthis is amazing I mean this is just\n\n24:43\ngaslighting at the highest level so you\n\n24:45\ndo a bad thing and then we notice you\n\n24:48\ndoing the bad thing and then the media\n\n24:50\nsay the bad thing is happening because\n\n24:52\nyou noticed not because the person\n\n24:54\noriginally is doing a bad thing but\n\n24:55\nbecause you noticed and because you\n\n24:56\nnoticed and you said something other\n\n24:58\npeople are taking from that the bad\n\n25:00\nthing is happening which they wouldn't\n\n25:01\nhave known in the first place unless you\n\n25:03\nsaid it\n\n25:04\nby this token by the way we should\n\n25:05\ndisband the entire media because the\n\n25:07\nmedia actually cover bad things\n\n25:08\nhappening then they are obviously\n\n25:09\npromulgating the bad thing that's\n\n25:11\nhappening anytime the media promulgate a\n\n25:13\nstory in which somebody does something\n\n25:14\nbad and then people react to that story\n\n25:16\nand it's the media's fault so probably\n\n25:18\nshould just disband the media by Martha\n\n25:20\nraditz's logic\n\n25:21\nhere's ABC news's Martha raddatz doing\n\n25:23\nthe work of the Biden Administration\n\n25:26\nI don't think I've ever heard\n\n25:28\nPresident Biden say we have an open\n\n25:31\nboard come on over but people I have\n\n25:33\nheard say it for you are former\n\n25:36\npresident Trump or Ron DeSantis\n\n25:38\nthat message\n\n25:41\nreverberates\n\n25:43\nin Mexico and Beyond so they do get the\n\n25:47\nmessage that it is an open quarter and\n\n25:50\nSmugglers use all those kinds of\n\n25:52\nstatements it was it was known for the\n\n25:54\ntime that Joe Biden got elected that Joe\n\n25:57\nBiden supported open borders it is known\n\n25:59\nby the cartels they have sophisticated\n\n26:02\ninformation whether or not the body\n\n26:04\nAdministration is going to enforce the\n\n26:06\nimmigration laws or not\n\n26:08\nthat's obviously true it's not that Greg\n\n26:11\nAbbott said it so people down in El\n\n26:12\nSalvador are like okay time to cross the\n\n26:14\nborder is that everyone knows the border\n\n26:16\nis open and that's why people are\n\n26:17\nrushing up okay none of that solves the\n\n26:19\nunderlying problem\n\n26:20\nlet's say that every Republican tomorrow\n\n26:22\nstops saying that the Border was open do\n\n26:23\nyou think people would stop coming or do\n\n26:25\nyou think maybe it's the bad policy that\n\n26:26\nis facilitating all this and this\n\n26:28\nobviously raises the question as to why\n\n26:29\nthe Biden Administration keeps pushing\n\n26:31\nbad policy why don't they close the\n\n26:33\nborder why did they stop the boarding\n\n26:34\nthe building of Trump's border wall\n\n26:36\nwhy are they getting rid of title 42\n\n26:38\nwithout anything to make up for its\n\n26:40\nabsence why did they try to end the\n\n26:42\nremain in Mexico policy why are they\n\n26:44\ndoing all these things\n\n26:45\nand the answer is pretty obvious I mean\n\n26:46\nChuck Schumer actually said it out loud\n\n26:48\nnot all that long ago Chuck Schumer said\n\n26:50\nthere aren't enough people in the United\n\n26:52\nStates to do a bunch of the low-level\n\n26:54\nwork and so we have to ship in low low\n\n26:56\neducation illegal immigrants into the\n\n26:58\ncountry that was Chuck Schumer he Senate\n\n27:00\nmajority leader who said that not me not\n\n27:02\npromulgators of these so-called great\n\n27:03\nreplacement Theory Chuck Schumer he said\n\n27:05\nwe're not having enough kids in this\n\n27:06\ncountry and you have to ship in\n\n27:07\nimmigrants\n\n27:08\nand if they have to come illegally they\n\n27:09\nhave to come illegally\n\n27:10\nthis is a purposeful policy by this\n\n27:12\nAdministration that's the only reason\n\n27:14\nyou have five million people who have\n\n27:16\ncrossed the border since the beginning\n\n27:17\nof this Administration that's an amazing\n\n27:19\nstatistic\n\n27:20\nand the media had an interest in looking\n\n27:22\nthe other way effectively speaking\n\n27:24\nbecause they all agree with the\n\n27:24\nadministration and so this is one of\n\n27:26\nthose issues that sort of flares up it's\n\n27:28\nlike a bad case of Gonorrhea every so\n\n27:29\noften it just flares up into the\n\n27:31\nAmerican public mind and then it goes\n\n27:32\naway when the media stop covering it\n\n27:33\njust suffice it to say Joe Biden has\n\n27:35\nstill never been to the Border because\n\n27:36\nJoe Biden does not care about border\n\n27:38\npolicy he's too busy with his big\n\n27:40\nspending policy\n\n27:41\nand here's the reality a giant welfare\n\n27:43\nstate is reliant on New Blood coming in\n\n27:45\nand providing the labor fodder for that\n\n27:47\nwelfare state now the problem is when\n\n27:49\nyou bring in a lot of people who then\n\n27:50\nbecome dependent on wealth are you\n\n27:51\nactually exacerbate the problem another\n\n27:53\nproblem is when you bring a lot of\n\n27:54\npeople in with no intention of\n\n27:55\nassimilating them to American rights and\n\n27:57\nduties then you've actually changed the\n\n27:59\nnature of the country\n\n28:00\nbut Joe Biden doesn't care about any of\n\n28:02\nthat for Democrats to sell short-term\n\n28:03\ngain and long-term pain\n\n28:06\nbut in the end as John Maynard King said\n\n28:08\nin the end in the long run we're all\n\n28:10\ndead so who cares\n\n28:11\nspeaking of people who are nearly dead\n\n28:13\nwho are going to continue running for\n\n28:14\nPresident Joe Biden is still planning on\n\n28:16\nrunning for president both Nancy Pelosi\n\n28:18\nand Chuck Schumer over the weekend said\n\n28:19\nthat Joe Biden should run again why not\n\n28:21\nI mean Nancy Pelosi is is well into her\n\n28:23\n200th year so why exactly shouldn't Joe\n\n28:26\nBiden run again he's a spring chicken by\n\n28:27\nthe standards of Chuck Schumer and Nancy\n\n28:28\nPelosi\n\n28:30\ndo you think President Biden should step\n\n28:33\naside for a younger generation\n\n28:36\nI think President Biden has done an\n\n28:39\nexcellent job as president of the United\n\n28:41\nStates I hope that he does seek\n\n28:44\nre-election he's a person with a great\n\n28:46\nvision for our country\n\n28:50\nhe's been doing an amazing job says\n\n28:52\nNancy Pelosi and and Chuck Schumer at\n\n28:54\nthe old age home\n\n28:56\namazing job by the way it is amazing\n\n28:58\nthat the Biden team is now apparently\n\n29:00\nprepping a strategy for his likely 2024\n\n29:02\nreelection campaign according to the\n\n29:03\nWashington Post it would dramatically\n\n29:05\nexpand efforts to organize content\n\n29:06\nsharing between supporters and their\n\n29:07\nfriends on digital platforms including\n\n29:09\nTick Tock and WhatsApp where political\n\n29:10\nadvertising is not allowed according to\n\n29:12\npeople involved in that effort so here's\n\n29:13\nthe rule when it comes to the use of\n\n29:15\ntechnology in order to facilitate\n\n29:16\ncampaigns when Democrats do it it's\n\n29:18\namazing and wondrous and the platforms\n\n29:20\nare great when Republicans do it it's\n\n29:21\nevil\n\n29:22\nthis is what we saw in 2012 when Barack\n\n29:24\nObama successfully used Facebook in\n\n29:25\norder to mobilize an extraordinarily\n\n29:27\nlarge voting base\n\n29:28\nand uh and then in 2016 when Cambridge\n\n29:32\nanalytica was using data from Facebook\n\n29:33\nin order to Target voters then Facebook\n\n29:35\nbecame evil so I'm sure we're about to\n\n29:37\nsee the same thing with Tick Tock and\n\n29:38\nWhatsApp according to the Washington\n\n29:40\nPost the plans which built upon lessons\n\n29:41\nfrom the 2020 campaign are one part of\n\n29:43\nan expensive research effort funded by\n\n29:45\nthe DNC to prepare for Biden's expected\n\n29:47\ncampaign launch next year top advisors\n\n29:49\nhave been testing ways to reactivate\n\n29:50\nvolunteers and donors they completed a\n\n29:52\nreview this summer of the shifts in how\n\n29:53\nvoters consume political information\n\n29:54\nover the past two years the review found\n\n29:56\nphone-based apps and streaming\n\n29:58\ntelevision have grabbed an increasing\n\n29:59\nshare of attention from voters which\n\n30:00\noffer fewer opportunities for direct\n\n30:02\nadvertising local television news\n\n30:04\ncontinues to be popular so does search\n\n30:06\nengines but much of the focus of party\n\n30:08\nstrategists has been on groups of Voters\n\n30:09\nwho are increasingly spending time\n\n30:10\nconsuming information in private digital\n\n30:12\nenvironments mostly through their phones\n\n30:14\nor on public platforms where paid\n\n30:15\npolitical advertising is not actually\n\n30:16\navailable including chat threads\n\n30:18\nDemocratic strategists have concluded\n\n30:20\nthat in many cases volunteers can have\n\n30:21\nmore impact by creating or Distributing\n\n30:23\ncontent to their digital communities\n\n30:24\nthan by spending their time in a more\n\n30:26\ntraditional canvassing operation so\n\n30:28\nbasically they're not going to activate\n\n30:29\nall of your friend lists in order to\n\n30:31\nbother you on WhatsApp about voting for\n\n30:32\nJoe Biden this is their plan\n\n30:35\nand um it may work and it will be\n\n30:37\nconsidered a brilliant digital plan up\n\n30:39\nuntil the moment that Republicans adopt\n\n30:40\nthe same plan at which point these apps\n\n30:42\nwill be to blame and we'll have to have\n\n30:43\ngovernment regulation of WhatsApp to\n\n30:44\nprevent just this sort of stuff General\n\n30:46\nMalley Dylan senior Biden advisor said\n\n30:47\nquote the idea is not just to meet\n\n30:49\npeople where they are but it's to meet\n\n30:50\npeople everywhere they are and that's\n\n30:51\ncomplicated and hard as a result the\n\n30:53\nBiden team has been reviewing ongoing\n\n30:55\nexperiments run by the national party\n\n30:56\nand looking at Democratic Senate\n\n30:58\ncampaigns involving once obscure\n\n30:59\norganizing strategies which became more\n\n31:01\ncommon in the 2022 midterms the options\n\n31:03\ninclude paying social media influencers\n\n31:04\nto promote and share supportive content\n\n31:06\nthat's not corrupt at all so now going\n\n31:09\nto get you know the local makeup artist\n\n31:10\non on Tick Tock to start advertising for\n\n31:13\nJoe Biden encouraging volunteers or paid\n\n31:15\norganizers to directly push messages to\n\n31:17\ntargeted voters in their phone contacts\n\n31:19\nthere are also Technologies the party\n\n31:21\nhas been reviewing that make it easier\n\n31:22\nfor volunteers to share campaign content\n\n31:23\nto their Networks\n\n31:25\nagain it's brilliant when Democrats do\n\n31:27\nit it's very bad when Republicans do it\n\n31:28\nso watch for that emerging narrative now\n\n31:30\nthere's only one problem for Joe Biden\n\n31:32\nand all this and that is that he's still\n\n31:33\na bad president I mean I know that we\n\n31:35\nkeep pretending that Joe Biden is an\n\n31:36\namazing president because he's he dodged\n\n31:38\nthe bullet in 2022\n\n31:40\nbut the reality is that if you look at\n\n31:42\nJoe Biden's job approval rating that\n\n31:45\ndude is still way underwater according\n\n31:46\nto the latest Harvard Harris poll he's\n\n31:48\nstill down at 42 percent approval rating\n\n31:51\naccording to Reuters he's down at 39\n\n31:53\napproval rating\n\n31:55\nthe only one that even has him in\n\n31:56\nspitting distance of 50 is yougov which\n\n31:59\nstill has him at 45 his overall Real\n\n32:02\nClear Politics polling Average Joe\n\n32:03\nBiden's job approval is 43 these are not\n\n32:06\ngood numbers\n\n32:07\nthese are terrible numbers for Joe Biden\n\n32:09\nand yet the Democratic party seems to\n\n32:11\nbelieve that this guy is a big winner\n\n32:13\nso\n\n32:15\nagain the mask of the 2022 election\n\n32:16\ncould come back to really harm Democrats\n\n32:19\nhere they might think that he's doing an\n\n32:20\namazing job because they didn't get\n\n32:22\nshellacked in 2022 because the\n\n32:23\nRepublicans raided the local homeless\n\n32:24\nshelter for candidates\n\n32:26\nbut as it turns out Joe Biden is an\n\n32:27\nextraordinarily weak candidate which\n\n32:29\npresumably is just another reason why\n\n32:31\nthe January 6th committee is going ahead\n\n32:33\nwith a bunch of criminal referrals for\n\n32:34\nDonald Trump the goal is is sort of a\n\n32:37\nwin-win for them one\n\n32:38\nthey got to either criminally refer\n\n32:40\nDonald Trump and then he's prosecuted in\n\n32:42\nwhich case they get to ask every single\n\n32:44\nRepublican about Donald Trump's\n\n32:45\nprosecution in January 6th and make\n\n32:46\nelection of 2024 about 2020. or\n\n32:50\nthey fail and they somehow\n\n32:52\nallow Donald Trump to regain coherence\n\n32:56\nand they and they sort of jog Trump to\n\n32:58\nnew heights in the polling which very\n\n33:00\noften happens when Democrats attack\n\n33:01\nTrump Republicans naturally tend to move\n\n33:03\ninto Trump's Corner that's what happened\n\n33:05\nafter the Mar-A-Lago raids right after\n\n33:06\nthe Mar-A-Lago raids a lot of\n\n33:09\nRepublicans moved if you look at Joe\n\n33:10\nBiden's job of who's being unfairly\n\n33:12\ntargeted which seems to have been true\n\n33:14\nbased on the fact that he was not\n\n33:16\nactively attempting to disseminate\n\n33:17\nserious classified information or any\n\n33:18\nclassified information to foreign powers\n\n33:21\nso Democrats could be looking at a\n\n33:23\nwin-win with the January 6th committee\n\n33:25\nresult which is why it was always rigged\n\n33:26\nin the first place we'll get to that in\n\n33:27\njust a moment well folks the

extraordinarily\n\n34:24\nweak candidate then he has to rely on\n\n34:25\nRepublicans sucking at this in order to\n\n34:27\nwin again in 2024. and this is\n\n34:29\npresumably where the January 6th\n\n34:30\ncommittee came in it's why so many\n\n34:32\nRepublicans were very upset with people\n\n34:33\nlike Liz Cheney and Adam kinzinger for\n\n34:35\ndoing cover for the January 6th\n\n34:36\ncommittee because they weren't there to\n\n34:37\nask holistic questions about what\n\n34:39\nCongress could do to prevent further\n\n34:41\nevents like January 6th instead the\n\n34:43\nwhole thing was about how do we provide\n\n34:44\nfodder for Democrats so they can turn\n\n34:46\nthe entirety of of campaign 2022 and\n\n34:49\n2024 into a referendum on whether\n\n34:51\nJanuary 6th was bad or not well now we\n\n34:53\nare reaching the end of the January 6th\n\n34:55\ncommittee according to Politico the\n\n34:57\nhouse generation select committee meets\n\n34:59\nat 1 pm today to vote on its final\n\n35:00\nreport and possible criminal referrals\n\n35:02\nagainst Donald Trump\n\n35:04\napparently Kyle Chaney says that the\n\n35:07\nhouse January 6 committee is convening\n\n35:08\nthis afternoon to wrap up a business\n\n35:11\nthey are going to fill in the record\n\n35:13\ntheir decision it says Kyle Chaney to\n\n35:15\nrecommend criminal charges for Donald\n\n35:16\nTrump will suck up a lot of oxygen the\n\n35:17\nmore significant development will be the\n\n35:18\nsheer volume of new details and\n\n35:20\ninformation the panel supplies to back\n\n35:21\nup the eye-popping contentions in the\n\n35:23\nairport for instance I want to know what\n\n35:24\nevidence of witness tampering the\n\n35:25\ncommittee has which they've teased\n\n35:27\nduring some of the public hearings now\n\n35:28\nhere's the reality they've been teasing\n\n35:30\nall along in the same way that Adam\n\n35:31\nSchiff kept teasing and teasing and\n\n35:32\nteasing that there was going to be a\n\n35:33\nRussian collusion bombshell that never\n\n35:35\nactually dropped they've been teasing\n\n35:36\nall along there's going to be some\n\n35:37\nbombshell showing that Trump knew it was\n\n35:39\nillegal to seek alternative slates of\n\n35:42\nelectors Nuki had lost and therefore was\n\n35:45\nattempting to subvert the constitution\n\n35:46\nin finding an alternative slate of\n\n35:47\nelectors I have serious doubt as to\n\n35:49\nwhether they're going to be able to\n\n35:49\nprove that actual case\n\n35:52\nin reality it's very likely that the\n\n35:54\nJanuary 6 committee was always going to\n\n35:56\ndo this whether the doj acts on it is is\n\n35:58\nfairly irrelevant at this point they'll\n\n36:00\nget the headline the doj of course\n\n36:02\nalready has a special counsel working on\n\n36:05\nthe January 6th case as well as the\n\n36:06\nMar-A-Lago case\n\n36:08\nthe doj has already brought in some of\n\n36:11\nthe highest level figures in Trump's\n\n36:12\norbit according Kyle Chaney over\n\n36:13\nPolitico reaching the upper echelons of\n\n36:15\nhis administration that's usually a sign\n\n36:16\nof a mature investigation that could be\n\n36:17\nnearing a charging decision and also\n\n36:19\nthere's a Fulton County grand jury which\n\n36:21\nhas similarly fought in one battles to\n\n36:22\nobtain testimony for many of Trump's top\n\n36:24\naides again what is the goal here the\n\n36:27\ngoal here presumably is to hang January\n\n36:30\n6 around Republicans neck from here\n\n36:32\nuntil the end of time and they have to\n\n36:33\ndo this it worked in 2022 of course and\n\n36:35\nmany of the people that Donald Trump\n\n36:36\nsided with many of the people who are\n\n36:38\nmost strong about their claims the 2020\n\n36:39\nelection was overtly stolen and that\n\n36:41\nTrump actually won went down in flaming\n\n36:43\ndefeat in their various senatorial races\n\n36:45\nit was a major factor and Republicans\n\n36:47\nnot taking back the Senate this year the\n\n36:49\nfirst election in an extraordinarily\n\n36:50\nlong time in which is single and cutting\n\n36:52\nout a single incumbent on the Democratic\n\n36:54\nparty side of the aisle lost in the\n\n36:55\nSenate an amazing accomplishment\n\n36:58\napparently according to Politico the\n\n37:00\nWhite House is closely watching whether\n\n37:02\nthe committee refers House GOP leader\n\n37:03\nKevin McCarthy and representative Jim\n\n37:04\nJordan for ethics sanctions after\n\n37:06\ndefying the panel subpoenas you can bet\n\n37:08\nthat Biden allies will frequently cite\n\n37:09\ntheir abstinence in the media and\n\n37:10\npotentially in the courts as the GOP\n\n37:12\nsends subpoenas down Pennsylvania Avenue\n\n37:14\nstarting on January 3rd a person\n\n37:16\nfamiliar with the White House is\n\n37:17\nthinking summarize the message sent by\n\n37:18\nthe likely new speaker and Judiciary\n\n37:19\nCommittee chair subpoenas for thee but\n\n37:21\nnot for me so they're going to to\n\n37:22\nattempt to essentially suggest that they\n\n37:25\ndon't have to abide by any subpoenas\n\n37:26\nbecause Kevin McCarthy and Jim Jordan\n\n37:28\ndidn't decide to show up in front of the\n\n37:30\nCongressional committee to be grilled by\n\n37:32\ntheir fellow legislators\n\n37:34\nnow Adam Schiff now who is a\n\n37:37\nmisinformation font par Excellence it's\n\n37:39\nwhat he does he's just a a continuous\n\n37:42\nspout of misinformation\n\n37:43\nand also a person who actually has put\n\n37:45\nup a pup tent outside the CNN Green Room\n\n37:48\nhe's on the national TVs over the\n\n37:50\nweekend explaining that there is\n\n37:52\nevidence that Trump committed criminal\n\n37:53\noffenses now in reality\n\n37:55\nCongress does not have the power to\n\n37:57\ncharge obviously and the doj is going to\n\n37:59\nbe determining whether they even think\n\n38:00\nthat he committed criminal offenses and\n\n38:01\nthen there will have to be a jury trial\n\n38:02\nif in fact they think the criminal\n\n38:04\noffenses occurred I'm not going to\n\n38:06\nlisten to Adam Schiff on this talk about\n\n38:07\nsomebody who's blown out his credibility\n\n38:09\ndo you think the evidence is there that\n\n38:12\nDonald Trump committed any of the crimes\n\n38:14\nI just mentioned and that the cases are\n\n38:16\nprosecutable that you could get a\n\n38:18\nconviction I think that the evidence is\n\n38:21\nthere that Donald Trump committed uh\n\n38:23\ncriminal offenses in connection with his\n\n38:25\nefforts to overturn the election\n\n38:27\num and viewing it uh as a former\n\n38:29\nprosecutor I think there's sufficient\n\n38:32\nevidence to to charge the president\n\n38:37\nuh nobody believes you Adam Schiff this\n\n38:39\nis part of the problem when you blow out\n\n38:40\nyour credibility you don't get it back\n\n38:41\nquite that quickly you know Adam Schiff\n\n38:43\nlet the cat out of the bag here he\n\n38:44\nbasically said I hope that they charge\n\n38:46\nhim in the middle of all of this because\n\n38:48\nI wanted to still be politically\n\n38:49\nrelevant\n\n38:50\nthis has been the Democrats chief goal\n\n38:52\nfrom the beginning is to keep Donald\n\n38:53\nTrump at the center of the public\n\n38:54\nconversation because the more people are\n\n38:55\ntalking about Trump the less they're\n\n38:56\ntalking about Joe Biden doing a crappy\n\n38:57\njob and allowing for example 5 million\n\n38:59\nlegal immigrants into the country here's\n\n39:00\nAdam Schiff saying the quiet part out\n\n39:02\nloud here do you think\n\n39:05\nthat Donald Trump is going to face some\n\n39:08\nkind of criminal charges uh in the\n\n39:10\ncoming months independent from your\n\n39:12\ninvestigation\n\n39:13\nuh the short answer is I don't know\n\n39:16\num\n\n39:17\nI think that he should I think you\n\n39:19\nshould face the same uh remedy force of\n\n39:21\nlaw that anyone else would\n\n39:23\num but I do worry that it it may take\n\n39:27\nuntil he is no longer politically\n\n39:29\nrelevant for justice to be served\n\n39:32\nthat's what he's worried about he wants\n\n39:34\nit done well Trump is politically\n\n39:35\nrelevant he wants to smack Republicans\n\n39:37\nwith it\n\n39:38\nnow the reality of course is that the\n\n39:40\nFBI the doj they're very often reluctant\n\n39:43\nto get involved in in issues that impact\n\n39:45\ncampaigns this was a story with Hillary\n\n39:47\nClinton in 2016 for example it's why\n\n39:48\nthere was Major controversy over James\n\n39:49\nComey opening his mouth\n\n39:51\nbut Adam Schiff would like for this to\n\n39:53\nhappen while Trump is politically\n\n39:54\nrelevant this is their Saving Grace\n\n39:57\nand Democrats cannot rely on their own\n\n39:58\ngood governance here in order to shift\n\n40:00\nthem into high gear for 2024. they're\n\n40:02\ngoing to have to rely on Republicans\n\n40:03\nbeing bad at this\n\n40:05\nnow the good news for them is that they\n\n40:06\ncan always find some Republicans who are\n\n40:08\nbad at this this is an insane story\n\n40:09\napparently there is a representative\n\n40:11\nelect named Georgia Santos he's a\n\n40:13\nrepublican from New York and there's a\n\n40:15\nreport in the New York Times that\n\n40:16\nbasically says that you know we'll take\n\n40:19\nit with a grain of salt it's the New\n\n40:20\nYork Times we'll see what Santos\n\n40:21\nresponds but it seems like this dude has\n\n40:23\nfalsified an extraordinary number of\n\n40:25\naspects of his actual biography\n\n40:27\nagain Congress is filled with all sorts\n\n40:29\nof weirdos I know a lot of Congress\n\n40:30\npeople on both sides of the aisle not\n\n40:32\nthe world's finest\n\n40:33\nit's not the best people but this\n\n40:36\nparticular story is pretty insane\n\n40:37\naccording to the New York Times George\n\n40:38\nSantos whose elections of Congress on\n\n40:40\nLong Island last month helped\n\n40:41\nRepublicans clinch a narrow majority in\n\n40:42\nthe House of Representatives built his\n\n40:44\ncandidacy on the notion who's the full\n\n40:45\nembodiment of the American dream and was\n\n40:47\nrunning to safeguard it for others his\n\n40:48\ncampaign biography Amplified his\n\n40:50\nstorybook Journey he's the son of\n\n40:51\nBrazilian immigrants the first to openly\n\n40:52\ngay Republican to win a house seat as a\n\n40:54\nnon-incumbent by his account he\n\n40:56\ncatapulted himself from a New York City\n\n40:57\npublic college to become a seasoned Wall\n\n40:58\nStreet financier and investor with a\n\n41:00\nfamily-owned real estate portfolio of 13\n\n41:02\nproperties and an animal rescue charity\n\n41:04\nthat saved more than 2 500 dogs and cats\n\n41:06\nbut in New York Times review of

Digital Services is generating revenues outside of Fabric in excess of $XXX\n 2. Digital Services is over $1Bn and growing YOY faster than our Data Center business\n 3. Our Partner Ecosystem is thriving with over XXX partners, YYY integrations, ZZZ use cases \n 4. Customer Feedback from Developers and Traditional Customers on our new offerings is excellent, we have greater than XXX transactional NPS \n 5. Our company valuation continues to grow as investors buy into the growth story of our platform offerings\n 6. Customers are able to engage our services in a self-service model with a pay-for-usage billing model \n\n2. Brandi\n \u00b7 Adoption rates have grown at XX rate. (I think we need an adoption metric to balance revenue\u2026.increased adoption may be leading indicator of revenue growth and enough to keep us investing. \n \u00b7 Customers and partners are able to engage our services in a self-service model with a pay-for-usage billing model\n \u00b7 Our partner ecosystem is activated across all products and services.\n \n3. Bruce\n \u00b7 Increase yield per cabinet from X to Y (If we commit to a number we will innovate to get there. I don\u2019t believe we can meaningfully grow yield without innovation, and we don\u2019t know exactly what innovation is required. This will be a forcing function) \n \u00b7 Interconnection as % of revenue growing from X to Y (same principle as above)\n \n4. Charles\n \n5. Jon\n \u00b7 Digital services is generating revenues outside of colo-related interconnection (exclude Fabric, IX, EC, MC) of > 500M.\n \u00b7 Digital services is growing attach-rate/adoption by existing or new customers to 100+ G2000 enterprises, or 1000+ paying customers (over $1k MRR)\n \u00b7 Our partner ecosystem is driving new incremental, low/no-touch acquisitions of > 20% of the partner deal mix.\n \u00b7 Our company valuation shows multiple expansion based on the growth/revenue opportunity of digital services being valued as high-growth cloud-like valuations additive to the core.\n \n6. Justin\n \u00b7 Digital services revenue from PLG/developer-led sales motion surpasses that of sales-led.\n \u00b7 X% (e.g. >50%) attach rate across digital services (more than half of DS customers use at least 2 digital services)\n \u00b7 Y% (e.g. > 25%) attach rate between data center services and digital services\n \u00b7 Lower marginal cost of development for each new service\n \u00b7 From product-centric to \u201cexperience-centric\u201d development model (from linear product curation & value creation to exponential multi-sided value creation)\u2026 Platforms can enable an \u201cinverted\u201d business model, where the value could be derived primarily from a community (e.g. developers and technology partners) driving down the marginal cost of new products or services to virtually zero.\n \u00b7 Developers love, praise and promote Platform Equinix (see diagrams for reference)\n\n \n \n \n \n \n7.

Keith\n \u00b7 I think it will be a multi-faceted view on success and outcomes. Yes, revenue growth will be important, but I think more important will be % of customers adopting digital services, number of services by deployment or customer, unit and total profitability as expressed in dollars with benefit to AFFO and AFFO per share, and rate of acceleration. Cash flow will create company valuation appreciation. Also, I think scale of infrastructure \u2013 number of countries, markets and buildings \u2013 will make a huge difference too. Speed of deployment will also be a tell-tale sign of success, which will determine the slope of the curve. \n \n9. Kurt\n \u00b7 Point of lack of clarify, even in the example it defines the platform mostly in reference to digital. I think our platform is a platform as we have a full continuum that supports metal, to hybrid, to full colo. There is dissonance in the statements above. Platform is not digital alone.\n 1. When we have an MVP that supports customers in gaining access to the full suite of Equinix services through one or more methods of interaction (i.e. self service to full service) and multiple methods of purchase (direct or indirect). [Note, I didn\u2019t say fully integrated billing, fully integrated portals, etc. But, we do need to have thoughtful ways to delivery a consistent look, feel and customer journey for the set of customers we want).\n \n 2. We have a fully developed self service capability for digital products across the full spectrum of digital products.\n 3. We have solved the issue of traditional colo products being sold digitally. What I mean by this is for colo customers who buy fabric, we need to make this easy within the environment they live in. Reality is, we need our colo customers to buy a lot of digital for digital to grow at the pace we want. Some of them may never by metal, but we certainly need it super easy to buy fabric and requiring them to move to a completely different system to buy the connectivity defeats the purpose. If they have to contract for fabric separately, why wouldn\u2019t they just buy the same service from a telecom they already have a contract with?\n \n 4. Have defined our target customer\n \n10. Mike\n \u00b7 Digital Services is generating X revenues per year. (I am fine with it being inclusive of Fabric)\n \u00b7 We have co-built at least three products in the market with leading companies.\n \u00b7 Customers can procure our digital services in a self-service model with a pay for usage billing model.\n \u00b7 We have created a sustainable support model for digital services.\n \n11. Milind\n\n12. Nicole \n \u00b7 People/Workforce/Brand:\n \u00b7 The workforce can clearly articulate the company vision. \n \u00b7 Brand identity is shifting in the market from data center company (space and power) to platform company. Metrics around reach, impressions, community engagement, style of customers hitting the platform, etc.. \n \n \u00b7 Growth and Bookings:\n \u00b7 Strategic value of the platform seen through net new customer growth of X percent, current customer growth across digital services of X percent (think measuring cross sell up sell) . \n \u00b7 Scale and growth being driven through key synergies with critical ecosystem partners. Think Dell, HPE, and VMW (as examples). We would have have clear goals/targets between the companies for growth, and have successful product partnerships/ co-branding. IE: Dell drives \u201cX\u201d number of customers and or revenue to the Equinix platform. \n \u00b7 Digital services hits $2B in revenue in 2 years (by end of 2025) and is growing at software market pace. Users would be consuming at rate exponentially higher than current state. \n \u00b7 Sustainability efforts are clearly defined and part of overall strategic mission. (thus, not slowing down sales and ability to pursue deals that require sustainability gates). Should we consider this as a potential service revenue stream in future state? I know there will be specific sustainability targets and expectations by region so we should build it in now to our metrics/strategic approach. \n \u00b7 Systems and Tools: \n \u00b7 We have successfully implemented key shifts in our own internal digital transformation to provide a delightful experience for customers. For example, \n 1) Automation is in place to enable the \u201cpull\u201d of the platform in instead of the \u201cpush\u201d it is today. Measure through metrics like employee productivity metrics, percentage of AI enabled tools, return on digital investments, Revenue/bookings from digital technology, ROI on digital/architecture investments. \n 2) Our architecture is designed for software style services and a simplified/seamless user experience. Similar metrics above could measure progress here I would think. \n \u00b7 We have unified interfaces and solutions instead of puzzle pieces we are trying to stitch together. We\u2019ve built a delightful experience for supporting our customers that want to buy multiple services together. This could be reflected through our NPS scores perhaps? \n \n13. PVC\n \u00b7 I believe all 6 of the above matter. Tougher to assign numbers or an expectation of 4 thru 6 in an outcome as yet, but some form of measured progress will need to happen\n \n14. Raouf\n \u00b7 Enterprise use cases become common and repeatable. \n \u00b7 Direct Sales team equipped to sell to the Enterprise. \n \u00b7 Customer experience is validated by customers. The on-demand model is scalable. \n \u00b7 PLG takes off and grows as a \u201cchannel\u201d to growth. \n \u00b7 Clear product roadmap and capabilities in place. \n \u00b7 The right product architecture and unit cost model to scale effectively. \n \u00b7 Scalable service model for Enterprise and PLG support. Robust self-service where customers value it. \n \u00b7 Market recognition of our position in the market as supported by customers. \n \n \n15. Ryan\n 1. Digital Services is generating $3B in X years.\n 2. Internally, Equinix S&B costs have costs are scaling, under-indexing to revenue growth. \n 3. The market understands and attributes distinctive value to the parts (DS, DCS, xScale) and the sum of the parts (Equinix). \n \n16. Scott\n \u00b7 I do not understand the premise or intent of the Phase 1 questions. I don't think a platform vision is \"proven\" at the time it is ready to scale (it is only proven in retrospect, years later). You have to make it scale, and while you\u2019re doing so, you encounter blockers every year or 18 months which you must overcome if you wish to continue scaling. If you fail to overcome those blockers (and evolve the platform based on market experience and evolution), it stops scaling. It is a continuum, not a point in time. So I'm not sure what we're asking here. Are we asking the thresholds we need to meet at various arbitrary stages of growth, or to tackle particular challenges or take particular actions? If so, I\u2019d argue $500M revenue and 25% CAGR without good BU/GTM alignment is a pretty clear indicator this has legs.\n\n \u00b7 In any event, at each stage of growth, we can expect increases in metrics such as:\n \u25cb Usage growth by product \n \u25cb Revenue and revenue growth and/or profitability/losses\n \u00b7 By business line\n \u00b7 By ecosystem partner (reselling our offerings)\n \u25cb Degree of sales enablement (# DS sales certifications earned, % of reps whose DS deals comprise y% of their revenue) \n \u25cb Degree of sales ease (# people who have to touch each deal, average deal time by revenue band, % revenue from PLG)\n \u25cb Support systems: We can't scale without a simple, effective and measurable support experience for users and customers. We should measure the key metrics and outcomes (by persona type (describing product affinity): NPS and NPS-T , by product: mean time to resolution, mean number of handoffs to resolution) against the best in the industry.\n \u25cb Marketing: % of marketing budget allocated to DS; CAC/LTV by products\n \u25cb Consumption of our services by ecosystem partners, by each major category of ecosystem partner\n \u25cb Community adoption (for open source offerings)\n \u00b7 The point, though, is that these targets will change every year. I don't understand what threshold we're seeking to quantify.", "input": ""}
{"category": "text_summarization", "instruction": "Summarize the following email and tell me all the most important points:\n\nHakeem, Alan and Steven -\n\nHere's a little background for y'all (having just come from California, I had to use that \ud83d\ude02)...\n\nShad and I met with Peter Bloom in La Jolla (San Diego) last week. Pete has been involved in a number of various energy projects over the years and he and I share an interest in antique heavy equipment (this is where I met him). After our meeting, Pete summarized our discussions - see his email below. I'm sharing this with you because in a way, Pete's email forms the skeleton of a business plan for R&R. He captured the main topics we discussed but we need to separate those major topics into their own \"stand alone\" business plans. \n\nFor now considering your present assignment, let's focus on utility work in the USA only. We can look at the other items later on. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, Alan and I developed a budget identifying the \"cost of doing business\" should we move to Texas or California. This summarizes the expenditures we'd expect such as personnel salaries, office rental, vehicles, etc. We did a three year forecast of these costs to see how much money we would need to operate a company down in the USA. This was a rather \"crude\" estimate in that all we did was multiply the rate or cost of an item by the number of units or hours. With respect to the number of hours that a person would contribute, we simply assumed two categories. One is where a person would have full time involvement and therefore would consume 2,080 hours, which is considered to be standard work year (40 hours a week x 52 weeks a year). The other is where they would have part-time involvement and in this case, we assumed they would only work half a year or 1,040 hours. Given more time, we need to refine this estimate a bit more. The main purpose of this budget was to seek financial assistance in the form of a business loan so we were \"conservative\" in our numbers in this estimate. In reality, our actual costs would likely be less but for the purposes of this budget (where we were seeking as much money as we could get), we went slightly overboard with our numbers.\n\nKnowing our costs, we now need to figure out how much revenue we could earn. How we earn revenue is by undertaking projects. So, what I asked Steven to do initially was some desktop research to identify potential projects in the Texas market that we'd be qualified to bid on - specifically, high voltage transmission line work. These could be found by searching various local utility websites. I think there are maybe six major utilities in Texas - like AEP Texas, CenterPoint Energy, Oncor Electric, Texas - New Mexico Power, etc. Projects should be listed on these (or similar) websites along with other information such as schedule (when they are expected to be built), estimated value, etc. After you collect this information, we'll then summarize it on a spreadsheet and assess the value of what we expect our portion of this work would be.\n\nAfter you gather all this information on the spreadsheet, we'll have what we need to complete our business plan and answer the questions Pete asks in his email. And from your research, we'll assume that we earn $X million in revenue per year less $Y million in expenses and the balance should be a positive number that represents our profit.\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n\nFor now, just see what you can do by identifying potential clients (utility companies) in Texas, their project list, the value of these projects and when they're expected to be built. With the information you provide, I'll do a draft of our business plan and share it with you so you can see how your work contributed to our plan.\n\nBest of luck and if you have any questions, please ask.\n\nAll the best!\n\nBill", "input": ""}

This shows the fragility of the system.\nNews agencies can try to explain the reasons as being poor risk management and losses on securities, they can blame the Federal Reserve, even here in Canada, regulators seized the assets of the Toronto branch.\nIs this something new? Not at all. We can talk about the virtual economy that is created by Rib\u0101 and the stock market. Numbers are overinflated and the wishful thinking of investors are culprits as well. All it takes is a slight loss in confidence. Depositors rush to the bank to withdraw their money, and stockholders also rush to sell their valueless stocks.\nWe should not get entrapped in the symptoms, brothers and sisters. What we are seeing today, what we saw in the 2008 financial crisis and others before it, are symptoms of the inherent problem.\nThe trouble started when money no longer carried any intrinsic value. Never in the history of man have we been in a situation in which money is literally created out of thin air by a cartel of private bankers. The Federal Reserve in the United States is not federal and it certainly has no reserves.\nBefore President Nixon's decision on August 15, 1971 to completely eliminate gold from the money equation, there was the gold exchange standard where money was tied to gold.\nBefore the gold exchange standard was the gold standard, and this was before the United States government, under President Franklin D Roosevelt, seized all gold from its citizens on March 9, 1933.\nConventional banking, which has its own history and development, is fueled by the modern fiat monetary system.\nBanks don't have money stored away. Money is created when banks give out loans. Money is created from debt!\nSo such collapses are not a surprise nor should they be.\nGold never gets old. If you have savings, invest them in gold coins outside of the grid. I mean go out and buy gold coins and store them away yourself.\nThe United States is bankrupt, and things will only get worse as time passes.\nIt is a blessing that I am in the process of writing my book on Rib\u0101 and Islamic banking. People in general, and Muslims in particular, have to have some foundational knowledge of how we came to the situation we are in today as far as the monetary system.\nWe have to know what is Shar\u012b\u2018ah compliant and adhere to it.\nThose convenient Fat\u0101w\u0101 about it being permissible to buy a house on a conventional mortgage in the West are not only fragile as far as their justifications and proofs, but as time continues, practical events will prove that there is nothing good about Rib\u0101.\nA house bought with Rib\u0101 is a cursed house.", "input": ""}
{"category": "text_summarization", "instruction": "list the top 4 points made in this text: The search for truth is as old as civilisation. After centuries of \u201ctruth\u201d being determined\nby religious authorities, the first information revolution in the West \u2013 the invention of the\nprinting press \u2013 democratised reading and learning. Post-Enlightenment democracies\nwould come to champion the open forum as the landscape for discovery. Truth and reason\ncould only be sought by allowing conflicting ideas to meet and be tested - and as such,\neven heresy could be seen by liberals as a virtue, not a sin. Technology had democratised\ntruth from fists of institutional power.\nBut our current technological revolution has redefined both the relationship between\npeople and power, and truth and power. Whilst billions of people across the globe can\nspeak to the world instantaneously, a handful of billionaires define the parameters of what\nthey can and cannot say. The internet has given rise to the possibility of the greatest\ndemocratisation of information in the history of humankind, and the greatest control of\ninformation and speech. As the open forum has been magnified, so too has the desire for\ncontrol by those who, whether benevolently or not, seek the power to define its limitations.\nThe preservation of \u201ctruth\u201d has re-emerged as a motivation for censorship on the internet\u2019s\nopen forums. The internet contains masses of incorrect information \u2013 but this is a defining\nfeature of an open forum, not a flaw. John Milton wrote in his 1644 essay Areopagitica,\n\u201cLet [Truth] and Falsehood grapple; whoever knew Truth put to the worse, in a free and\nopen encounter?\u201d Almost four centuries later, faced with technological dystopia, we find\nourselves having to make this foundational liberal argument afresh. As former Supreme\nCourt judge Lord Sumption wrote, arguing against a particularly censorious version of the\ngovernment\u2019s Online Safety Bill,\n\u201cWe have to accept the implications of human curiosity. Some of what people\nsay will be wrong. Some of it may even be harmful. But we cannot discover truth\nwithout accommodating error. It is the price that we pay for allowing knowledge and\nunderstanding to develop and human civilisation to progress.\u201d1\nThe basis of a belief in freedom of expression and its necessity for democracy is not only\nthat truth can withstand the mistruths that exist in an open forum, but that it requires it\n\u2013 the discovery of truth and the and evolution of knowledge is served by the most open\npossible forum.\nAs with almost all authoritarian arguments, modern pro-censorship views are partly defined\n1 The hidden harms in the Online Safety Bill \u2013 Jonathan Sumption, The Spectator, 20 August\n2022: https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-hidden-harms-in-the-online-safety-bill/\n1\nby exceptionalism. Technocrats argue that the digital revolution poses exceptional, new\nthreats and that the ability for people to post incorrect information or harmful views on\nsuch a far-reaching platform, without the gatekeeping associated with the printing press\u2019\ninformation revolution, makes wrong information particularly pernicious - even if is lawful.\nThe solution often offered to tackle the scourge of \u201cmisinformation\u201d is censorship, in one\nform or another. From de-ranking certain content to taking down posts or directing people\nto approved information sources, the antidote to misinformation has been posed as giving\nthose with power the ability to control speech further. In doing so, enormous power over\nthe public\u2019s freedom of expression has been seized in a swift and silent coup \u2013 first by Big\nTech corporations, then by governments, and increasingly, by a convergence of the two.\nWhilst presented as in the public interest, these censorship \u201csolutions\u201d centralise\npowerful interests, positioning them the arbiters of truth. The misinformation industry,\ncombining Big Tech companies, governments, international governance organisations\nand start-up \u201cfact-checker\u201d style organisations present themselves as the judges and\njuries of information, determining the parameters of acceptable speech.\nIt is the growing confluence of power between Big Tech and state powers that is the\nsubject of our investigation, and this report.\nFour key units operate out of Whitehall as the government\u2019s social media special forces,\neach with a distinct purpose.\nThe Rapid Response Unit (RRU), part of the Cabinet Office, was tasked with \u201ctackling a\nrange of harmful narratives online\u201d during the pandemic, \u201cfrom purported \u2018experts\u2019 issuing\ndangerous misinformation, to criminal fraudsters running phishing scams\u201d.2\nThe Counter Disinformation Unit (CDU), which was tasked to monitor what it deems to be\ndisinformation and flags content to social media companies, sits inside the Department\nfor Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Whilst the Government\u2019s use of these terms appears\nto be very loose, misinformation refers to any type of inaccurate information whereas\ndisinformation refers to deliberate false information, often spread with malicious intent.3\nIn response to the war in Ukraine, the Foreign Office established the Government\nInformation Cell (GIC) focused on identifying and countering Russian disinformation in\nthe UK and abroad about the Kremlin\u2019s war.\nMeanwhile, the Home Office\u2019s Research, Intelligence and Communications Unit (RICU)\n2 Government cracks down on spread of false coronavirus information online \u2013 Cabinet\nOffice, UK Government, 30th March 2020: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-cracksdown-\non-spread-of-false-coronavirus-information-online\n3 Factsheet 4: Types of Misinformation and Disinformation \u2013 UNHCR, February 2002: https://\nwww.unhcr.org/innovation/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Factsheet-4.pdf\n2\noperates to push official lines that support counter-extremism and has even set up\ndomestic front organisations to publish propaganda.\nA further unit is purported to actively counter \u201cdisinformation\u201d within the Ministry of\nDefence \u2013 the 77th Brigade, which is \u201ca combined Regular and Army Reserve unit\u201d which\naims to \u201cchallenge the difficulties of modern warfare using non-lethal engagement and\nlegitimate non-military levers as a means to adapt behaviours of the opposing forces and\nadversaries\u201d.4 However, our investigation, which includes an exclusive whistleblower\naccount, reveals that the reality of the unit\u2019s activities is far different.\nAll of these units operate in the shadows and are rarely forthcoming about their capabilities,\nactivities or reach, with the CDU being the least forthcoming with answers to transparency\nquestions. This is despite the CDU being part of the government department responsible\nfor the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Huge sums of public money, running into the\ntens of millions of pounds, have been spent on these units which have the potential\nto influence discussion online and even news reporting.

see the headlines asking if artificial intelligence will take our jobs much of this is hype but some of it gets it very real questions about ai's impact on our future the question is how can you be prepared and best adapt to the intelligently automated future i'm paul ratzer founder and ceo of marketing artificial intelligence institute in this video you'll learn what jobs will be taken over by ai in the future and what skills will remain essential in an ai first world i've done hundreds of talks on artificial intelligence and almost every time someone asks me right off the bat am i going to lose my job ai will replace humans in some jobs but it will also create new opportunities to understand what machines will excel at and what will remain uniquely human we have to start with what are machines very good at doing machines excel at things that are very hard for humans like intelligently automating repetitive tasks so doing things over and over and over again except the machine never gets tired it never forgets and it can just keep going the other is managing large data sets finding anomalies in the data sets making predictions based on that data the machine doesn't get tired of looking at data and analyzing it and so those are things that humans aren't very good at on the opposite end things that come easy for humans are very hard for machines walking it's very difficult to teach a machine how to walk object recognition like if a toddler looks at two objects and you say this is a cat and this is a dog the toddler is going to remember the difference machines don't work that way so that's a starting point to think about the things that remain uniquely human is to understand the things that machines are going to have a very hard time learning and excelling at the thing i always tell people is if you do a very specific repetitive task and that is all you do every day such as a b testing landing pages or figuring out media spend for digital advertising those things will go away those tasks machines are better at right now so if your job is a very specific repeatable task you should be looking for a new one right now and leveling up your skill sets so there will be some jobs but for the most part what's going to disappear are specific roles or tasks within jobs you're going to make a list of all these things you do every day and you're gonna find the things that you can intelligently automate because they're repetitive the other reality is anytime there's a major technological innovation or transformation in any industry new jobs are created that we can't imagine yet and that's the exciting thing to me is i think we're going to see a whole new realm of opportunities emerge for people to define totally new career paths applying ai to marketing in order to imagine what these future roles may look like we need to think about the skills and traits that remain uniquely human for example empathy a machine does not have feelings it doesn't understand human feelings there's lots of things you can do with emotion nai it can be trained to see sad faces it can use things called facial recognition to actually know that you're frowning or that you're crying and it can be told that that means that human is sad so if it knows that a human is sad it can actually evolve its prediction of messaging it might evolve the ads that are running to that person it might evolve the the images within ads but the machine itself doesn't feel emotion or truly understand human emotion so empathy is almost impossible to give to a machine and when you think about as a marketer how important that is to our job to understand consumers to understand pain points to understand fears they have we can't teach the machine those things and so empathy is a critical trait moving forward strategy is another uniquely human ability a machine doesn't know what to predict and it doesn't know what to do with the prediction unless it's told by a human there's a great book called prediction machines that says the future of all work in every industry is telling the machine what to predict and knowing what to do with the prediction and so when we think about marketing and how strategy applies the machine will be there to help solve problems it will be there to intelligently automate things but it needs to be told what to do what problems to solve and that's going to be where marketers come in is being able to look at problems in their business and say i know that ai can help me solve this better creativity i would argue remains uniquely human there are some ai experts who would say that ai has demonstrated creativity in solving problems but in my opinion it's math the the machine isn't taking life experiences and it's not using emotion to come up with new ideas it's not creative in the way that we are creative as humans when you think about music or artwork or writing so much of what we've gone through in our lives is what enables the output so much more goes into the creative process and so i would just say that to me creativity as we know it and have come to define it is not possible in machines curiosity is another that i consider uniquely human as humans so much of what we seek to discover and to learn comes from that curiosity within us to be better to go to new places the machine doesn't go looking for problems to solve it doesn't have intrinsic motivation to get better and so curiosity to me and all the things that become possible as a result of it remain uniquely human intuition is critical to the role of every marketer so much of what we decide to do is based on instinct machines don't have instinct they have probabilities of an outcome happening the real opportunity the real magic though comes when you combine those two things when the machine makes predictions based on probabilities and the human uses intuition to figure out if those predictions make sense once we understand the things that remain uniquely human and the things that the machine excels at ai actually has the potential to make us more human as individuals and as brands once the machines do what they do intelligently automating tasks it's going to drive efficiency within businesses it's going to free up human resources to do uniquely human things so you can look at it and say great we can cut costs we can reduce staff but what if you looked at it the other way and said well what good can we do with this time can we listen to our customers better can we be more socially responsible can we find better ways to get involved in the community and so there's this part of me that believes that ai is actually the opportunity to while intelligently automating tasks open up the possibility to become more human to become better people to do more good for our customers for our prospects for our employees and for society ai isn't making humans obsolete anytime soon but the landscape and the industry have changed in order to deliver the level of personalization and convenience that modern consumers expect brands must embrace ai and marketing must become marketer plus machine\"\nShare Prompt",

When employees are forced either to wait to get answers or to take chances and act independently, time and material resources are wasted through delay and error. This may be especially troublesome in emergencies when time must be devoted to tracking down a missing manager.\n\nEmployees should perceive a department manager as the employees\u2019 direct conduit when communicating with other organizational elements. This is especially true for interactions with higher management. Employees may perceive a manager who is not readily visible or available as being uninterested and uncaring. This is true for supervisors who seem dedicated primarily to activities such as meetings, committee work, conferences, and the like that occur outside of a department. Such activities put strain on the relationship between supervisor and employees, and the employees begin to see such a supervisor as indifferent and impersonal. For many members of a working group, their department manager is a representative of the organization itself. This supervisor is the member of management that these employees know best and may be the only member of management with whom they have a speaking relationship. If employees perceive their supervisor as being cold, uncaring, and impersonal, then they are likely to perceive the entire organization in the same manner. In most instances, a first-line manager is a worker as well as a manager. These supervisory responsibilities provide an additional resource for a department. When a manager is unavailable, a potentially productive resource is lost.\"", "input": ""}

{"category": "text_summarization", "instruction": "Summarize the text regarding joint tenancy:\n JOINT, COMMON, OR COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP\nJoint, common, or community ownership or co-ownership means simultaneous ownership of a\ngiven piece of property by several persons (two or more).4 The types of such ownership interests\ninclude the following:\nTenancy in Common\nTenancy in common exists when several (two or more) persons are owners of undivided interests\nin the title to real property. It is created if an instrument conveying an interest in real property to\ntwo or more persons does not specify that the interest is acquired by them in joint tenancy, in\npartnership, or as community property. Some instruments of transfer/deeds of conveyance\nclearly state the intentions of the persons acquiring are to hold title as tenants in common.5 No\nright of survivorship exists for individual tenants when title is held as tenants in common. The\nundivided interest of a deceased tenant in common passes to the beneficiaries (heirs or devisees)\nof the estate subject to probate, pursuant to the last will and testament of the deceased or by\nintestate succession. The heirs or devisees of the deceased simply take the tenant's place among\nthe other owners who continue to hold title to the property as tenants in common.6\nJoint Tenancy\nJoint tenancy exists if two or more persons are joint and equal owners of the same undivided\ninterest in real property. Generally, to establish a joint tenancy a fourfold unity must exist:\ninterest, title, time, and possession. Joint tenants have the same interest, acquired by the same\nconveyance, commencing at the same time, and held by the same possession.7\nThe most important characteristic of a joint tenancy is the right of survivorship that flows from\nthe unity of interest. The words \"with the right of survivorship\" are not necessary for a valid joint\ntenancy deed, although they are often inserted. If one joint tenant dies, the surviving joint tenant\n(or tenants) become(s) the owner(s) of the property to the exclusion of the heirs or devisees of\nthe deceased. Thus, joint tenancy property cannot be disposed of by the last will and testament, is\nnot subject to intestate succession, and typically does not become part of the estate of a joint\ntenant subject to probate.\nCreating A Joint Tenancy\nWith limited exception, California appellate courts have accepted and enforced the common law\nrule that if any one of the four unities \u2014 time, title, interest or possession \u2014 is lacking, a tenancy\nin common, not a joint tenancy, exists. An exception to the general rule has been more recently\napplied in connection with the time of acquisition of the title to the property. Consultation with\nknowledgeable legal counsel is recommended to answer questions that may be posed by property\nowners regarding the establishment of joint tenancies and the legal, practical, tax, estate\nplanning, and other considerations involved.\n 4 See Civil Code Section 682. 5 See Civil Code Section 685. 6 See Probate Code Section 6400 et seq. 7 See Civil Code Section 683.\nReal Property Ownership and Deed Recording\n4\nHowever, by statute a joint tenancy may be created:8\n1. By transfer from a sole owner to himself or herself and others as joint tenants.\n2.

By transfer from joint tenants to themselves, or to any of them, or to others as joint\ntenants.\n4.

{"category": "text_summarization", "instruction": "\"Summarize the following essay: Today\u2019s Masculinity Is Stifling\nAs boys grow up, the process of becoming men encourages them to shed the sort of intimate connections and emotional intelligence that add meaning to life.\n\nSARAH RICH\nThe Atlantic Magazine\nJUNE 11, 2018\nIn hindsight, our son was gearing up to wear a dress to school for quite some time. For months, he wore dresses\u2014or his purple-and-green mermaid costume\u2014on weekends and after school. Then he began wearing them to sleep in lieu of pajamas, changing out of them after breakfast. Finally, one morning, I brought him his clean pants and shirt, and he looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m already dressed.\u201d\n\nHe was seated on the couch in a gray cotton sundress covered in doe-eyed unicorns with rainbow manes. He\u2019d slept in it, and in his dreaming hours, I imagine, stood at a podium giving inspirational speeches to an audience composed only of himself. When he\u2019d woken up, he was ready.\n\nHe walked the half block to school with a bounce in his step, chest proud. \u201cMy friends are going to say dresses aren\u2019t for boys,\u201d he told me casually over his shoulder. \u201cThey might,\u201d I agreed. \u201cYou can just tell them you are comfortable with yourself and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d I thought of all the other things he could tell them. I began to list them, but he was off running across the blacktop.\n\nI scanned the entrance to see whether any parents noticed us as they came and went. I hadn\u2019t expected my stomach to churn. I felt proud of him for his self-assuredness, for the way he\u2019d prepared for this quietly and at his own pace, but I worried about what judgments and conclusions parents and teachers might make. And of course I worried somebody would shame him.\n\nWhen he walked into his classroom, sure enough, one child immediately remarked, \u201cWhy are you wearing a dress? Dresses are for girls.\u201d A teacher swiftly and gently shut down the child\u2019s commentary and hugged my son tightly. He didn\u2019t look troubled, didn\u2019t look back at me, so I headed home, tucking a backup T-shirt into his cubby just in case his certainty flagged.\n\nIn the afternoon, he was still wearing the unicorn dress. He skipped down the sidewalk, reporting that some kids had protested his attire, but he\u2019d assured them that he was comfortable with himself.\n\nWith that, the seal was broken. Most days since, he\u2019s worn a dress from his small collection, though he also favors a light-blue guayabera\u2014the classic collared button-down worn by men and boys in Cuba and the Philippines. Classmates\u2019 objections continued, but with less frequency and conviction. One day when my husband dropped him off, he heard a little girl stand up to a naysayer and shout, \u201cBoys can like beautiful things, too!\u201d\n\nBut they can\u2019t. Not without someone looking askance. To embrace anything feminine, if you\u2019re not biologically female, causes discomfort and confusion, because throughout most of history and in most parts of the world, being a woman has been a disadvantage. Why would a boy, born into all the power of maleness, reach outside his privileged domain? It doesn\u2019t compute.\n\nAs much as feminism has worked to rebalance the power and privilege between the sexes, the dominant approach to launching young women into positions that garner greater respect, higher status, and better pay still mostly maintains the association between those gains and masculine qualities. Girls\u2019 empowerment programs teach assertiveness, strength, and courage\u2014and they must to equip young women for a world that still overwhelmingly favors men.\n\nLast year, when the Boys Scouts of America announced that they would begin admitting girls into their dens, young women saw a wall come down around a territory that was now theirs to occupy. Parents across the country had argued that girls should have equal access to the activities and pursuits of boys\u2019 scouting, saying that Girl Scouts is not a good fit for girls who are \u201cmore rough and tumble.\u201d But the converse proposition was essentially nonexistent: Not a single article that I could find mentioned the idea that boys might not find Boy Scouts to be a good fit\u2014or, even more unspeakable, that they would want to join the Girl Scouts.\n\nIf it\u2019s difficult to imagine a boy aspiring to the Girl Scouts\u2019 merit badges (oriented far more than the boys\u2019 toward friendship, caretaking, and community), what does that say about how American culture regards these traditionally feminine arenas? And what does it say to boys who think joining the Girl Scouts sounds fun? Even preschool-age boys know they\u2019d be teased or shamed for disclosing such a dream.\n\nWhile society is chipping away at giving girls broader access to life\u2019s possibilities, it isn\u2019t presenting boys with a full continuum of how they can be in the world. To carve out a masculine identity requires whittling away everything that falls outside the norms of boyhood. At the earliest ages, it\u2019s about external signifiers like favorite colors, TV shows, and clothes. But later, the paring knife cuts away intimate friendships, emotional range, and open communication.\n\nThere\u2019s research connecting this shedding process to the development, in some adolescent boys, of depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation. In her 2014 documentary The Mask You Live In, the filmmaker Jennifer Siebel Newsom features the voices of dozens of teen boys describing their progression from childhoods rich with friendships to teen years defined by posturing and pressure to prove their manhood. Some of the boys, who present tough exteriors, admit to having suicidal thoughts. The film flashes news clips from the most notable mass shootings of that time\u2014Virginia Tech, Aurora, Sandy Hook\u2014each committed by a young man. \n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s homicidal violence or suicidal violence, people resort to such desperate behavior only when they are feeling shamed and humiliated, or feel they would be, if they didn\u2019t prove that they were real men,\u201d the psychiatrist James Gilligan, who directed Harvard\u2019s Center for the Study of Violence, says in the film.\n\nThere are so few positive variations on what a \u201creal man\u201d can look like, that when the youngest generations show signs of reshaping masculinity, the only word that exists for them is nonconforming. The term highlights that nobody knows what to call these variations on maleness. Instead of understanding that children can resist or challenge traditional masculinity from within the bounds of boyhood, it\u2019s assumed that they\u2019re in a phase, that they need guidance, or that they don\u2019t want to be boys.\n\nNumerous parents of gender-nonconforming children report initially trying to stifle their child\u2019s tendencies out of a protective instinct, thinking they might forestall bullying if only their child would fit more neatly into the box that\u2019s been set up for them. Ultimately, though, most realize that their child is less happy when prevented from gravitating naturally toward their preferences.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that there are children who do feel they\u2019ve been born in the wrong body, who long for different anatomy, a different pronoun. Trans kids need to be supported and accepted. And, at the same time, not every boy who puts on a dress is communicating a wish to be a girl. Too often gender dysphoria is conflated with the simple possibility that kids, when not steered toward one toy or color, will just like what they like, traditional gender expectations notwithstanding. There is little space given to experimentation and exploration before a child\u2019s community seeks to categorize them. Boyhood, as it is popularly imagined, is so narrow and confining that to press against its boundaries is to end up in a different identity altogether.\n\nAccording to the San Jose State University sociologist Elizabeth Sweet, who studies gender in children\u2019s toys throughout the 20th century, American gender categories are more rigid now than at any time in history, at least when it comes to consumer culture. There may be greater recognition in the abstract that gender exists along a spectrum, but for young children (and their parents), consumer products have a huge influence over identity development and presentation. \u201cToymakers are saying, well, we can sell each family one toy, or if we make separate versions according to gender, we can sell more toys and make families buy multiples for each gender,\u201d Sweet told me. The same holds true for clothes, baby gear, school supplies, even snack food. And parents begin gender-coding their children\u2019s worlds before those children are even born, sometimes kicked off by \u201cgender reveal\u201d parties, a sort of new version of the baby shower, in which parents-to-be discover the sex of their baby alongside family and friends through a dramatic, colorful display.\n\nThere is so much parents can\u2019t know when a baby hasn\u2019t been born\u2014they can\u2019t know the baby\u2019s hair color or eye color or whether they\u2019ll be colicky or peaceful, healthy or sick. But they can know their child\u2019s anatomy, and with that information they can create a to-do list full of tasks that quell the angst of knowing so little else. They can paint a nursery, buy onesies, pick names. A baby\u2019s sex creates a starting point on a cultural road map that the whole family and community can use to direct the child towards defining who they are, and who they are not.\n\nOf course today, among a certain set, there\u2019s an active rejection of pink for baby girls, whose parents don\u2019t want them treated as delicate flowers. But again, the reverse still has no purchase. Exceedingly few parents dress their baby boys in a headband and a dress.\n\nSomewhat ironically, those pink-foresaking parents of infant girls often find themselves, three years later, remarking that in spite of shielding their daughters from overly feminized colors, toys, and media, they\u2019ve still turned out to be princess-obsessed preschoolers. The parents display lighthearted self-consciousness that they couldn\u2019t render their girl immune to sparkles.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely, though, that they shame their girls for their \u201cgirliness.\u201d They throw up their hands and acquiesce to an Elsa costume. By contrast, boys\u2019 parents tend to double down on reinforcing masculinity.\n\n\u201cMost nonconforming adult men, when they talk about their upbringing, say their first bully was their dad,\u201d reports Matt Duron, whose wife, Lori Duron, wrote the book Raising My Rainbow, about their gender-creative son. Matt, who had a 20-year career as a police officer in Orange County, California, has been a vocal supporter of his son, though in their conservative region, his stance has been attacked. The Durons\u2019 son, now 11, gave up dresses years ago, but he still loves makeup and wears his hair long. Classmates bully him, but he finds support from his family, and lately at Sephora in his local mall, where male employees demonstrate a different way to be grown men in the world.\n\nThe idea of Sephora as a haven for gender-creative suburban American boys is touching and wonderful in its way, but it\u2019s bittersweet that alternate models of masculinity are so scarce and relatively unvaried. There are now quite a few books featuring boys who like dresses, but almost all of them follow the same arc: Boy dons dress among friends; boy gets shamed and bullied; boy becomes despondent and hides at home; then, finally, boy returns to friend group and they see his value and embrace him (usually after one last-ditch attempt to reform him through shame). Each time I pick up one of these to read to my son, I find myself wanting to change the narrative or skip the portions where rejection and suffering show up as inevitable.\n\n\u201cBut little kids live in the real world,\u201d Ian Hoffman argued when I questioned the trope. Hoffman co-authored the children\u2019s book Jacob\u2019s New Dress with his wife, Sarah. \u201cWould it be nice to have a book with a boy in a dress with no conflict? Yes. Are we there? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Hoffman told me. He says when the book was published in 2014, he and Sarah dreamed that someday it would seem quaint that a boy in a dress was a big deal. Then, just a year ago, their book was banned in North Carolina, cut from a public-school unit on bullying and harassment. \u201cThe initial first-grade book selection, which focuses on valuing uniqueness and difference, has been replaced due to some concerns about the book,\u201d the superintendent of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools system told The New York Times. One can imagine that if it had been about a girl who dressed as a firefighter, such extreme measures would not have been taken.\n\nThere\u2019s a word for what\u2019s happening here: misogyny. When school officials and parents send a message to children that \u201cboyish\u201d girls are badass but \u201cgirlish\u201d boys are embarrassing, they are telling kids that society values and rewards masculinity, but not femininity. They are not just keeping individual boys from free self-expression, but they are keeping women down too.\n\nIt is lopsided to approach gender equality by focusing only on girls\u2019 empowerment. If society is to find its way to a post-#MeToo future, parents, teachers, and community members need to build a culture of boyhood that fosters empathy, communication, caretaking, and cooperation. But how? Could there be a space or an organization for boys where they\u2019re encouraged to challenge what\u2019s expected of them socially, emotionally, and physically? What would the activities be? What would the corresponding catchwords be to the girls\u2019 \u201cbrave\u201d and \u201cstrong\u201d other than \u201ccowardly\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d? \n\nIt\u2019s a societal loss that so many men grow up believing that showing aggression and stifling emotion are the ways to signal manhood. And it\u2019s a personal loss to countless little boys who, at best, develop mechanisms for compartmentalizing certain aspects of who they are and, at worst, deny those aspects out of existence.\n\nThis fall, our son will start kindergarten, and with kindergarten comes a school uniform. This means pale blue collared shirts for all the kids, paired with navy blue pants, jumpers, or skirts. Currently there don\u2019t seem to be any boys at the school who choose the jumper or skirt, and it remains to be seen whether our son will maintain his penchant for dresses even when the sartorial binary becomes starker\u2014and the dresses more plain. \n\nWhatever he decides is fine with us. My only hope is that if he chooses to stop wearing dresses, it won\u2019t be due to feeling that his fullest self-expression no longer has a place. What I want for him, and for all boys, is for the process of becoming men to be expansive, not reductive. I know I\u2019m not alone. More than a century ago, in the October 1902 edition of London\u2019s Cornhill Magazine, the writer and poet May Byron wrote a piece called \u201cThe Little Boy,\u201d in which she talked, among other things, about boys\u2019 evolving mode of dress as they move through childhood. She tied it then, as I do now, to a mildly tragic departure from a boy\u2019s richest relationship with himself:\n\n\u201cPetticoated or kilted, in little sailor suits, and linen smocks, and velvet coats, and miniature reefers, he marches blindly on his destiny,\u201d Byron writes. \u201cSoon he will run his dear little head against that blank wall of foregone conclusions which shuts out fairyland from a workaday world.\u201d\"", "input": ""}

{"category": "text_summarization", "instruction": "Following is a youtube video transcript. Can you summarize it for me:\n\n0:00\nso i recommend posting to both airbnb\n0:02\nand vrbo regardless of what air dna says\n0:05\nwhere people are mainly listing in your\n0:06\narea if you don't what i'm talking about\n0:08\nhere here when you come and this is on\n0:09\nthe free version as well it'll show you\n0:11\nwhere hosts are listing their properties\n0:12\neither airbnb or vrp or both regardless\n0:14\nof what it says i think it's important\n0:16\nto be diversified on both platforms you\n0:18\nknow most cases most of your bookings\n0:19\nwill come from airbnb but you know again\n0:21\nit never hurts to be diversified you\n0:22\nknow reason being even if you get 10 to\n0:24\n20 of your bookings from vrbo that's\n0:26\nmoney that you're leaving on the table\n0:28\nand later in this training i'll be\n0:29\nshowing you how to automate your\n0:30\nmessaging and calendar on both platforms\n0:32\nanyway so i'll just take the few extra\n0:33\nminutes it will take to post a vrbo as\n0:35\nwell now before we jump in make sure to\n0:37\ncreate a brand new email for both\n0:38\nlistings just like we did when creating\n0:40\na separate bank account for your\n0:41\nbusiness same idea here we want to\n0:43\nseparate your personal from your\n0:45\nbusiness as much as possible to keep\n0:46\nthings clean now posting your listing is\n0:48\npretty intuitive and both platforms walk\n0:50\nyou through step by step but i'm going\n0:51\nto share a few things along the way that\n0:52\nare important to note this is just a\n0:54\nlittle tip that i picked up along the\n0:55\nway for whatever reason if you have a\n0:57\nsignificant other heck even if it's your\n0:59\nmom i would list their name here on the\n1:01\nlisting if you have a female name people\n1:02\nlike to book and it creates a layer of\n1:04\ntrust that i don't really understand but\n1:06\nonce i started putting my wife's name in\n1:08\nhere it seemed to get more booking so\n1:10\nyou know again this is one of those\n1:11\nplacebo things that i feel like is\n1:12\nworking so if it ain't broke then don't\n1:14\nfix it all right so let's go in here\n1:16\ncreate a new listing and again something\n1:17\nthat airbnb is shifting over to is\n1:20\ncreating a unique experience and so\n1:22\nwhatever you know you're going to be\n1:23\ndoing so let's say you're doing an\n1:24\napartment and then you also want to\n1:26\ndescribe what kind of place that you're\n1:28\nin so let's say we have a loft here\n1:30\nentire place and then let's say you know\n1:32\nwe want to pick your address let's say\n1:35\nit's right here let's say you can fit\n1:36\nsix people you can have four beds and\n1:39\nthey're say it's two-bedroom and then\n1:41\nyou wanna make sure you come in here and\n1:42\njust pick all of the different amenities\n1:44\nthat your place has you know especially\n1:45\nif it's an apartment then you wanna go\n1:47\nin here check all the amenities that\n1:48\nyour apartment offers and then you can\n1:50\ncome in here and just click all these on\n1:52\nagain this isn't gonna be the full\n1:53\ncomprehensive amenities that you can\n1:55\ninclude there's a lot more that you can\n1:56\nadd after you post your listing live all\n1:58\nright now this is super important and\n1:59\nthis is where your professional photos\n2:01\nwill come into play i'll use one of my\n2:02\nlistings photos to show you how i would\n2:04\nrearrange them depending on how i think\n2:06\nthey look and which photo really grabs\n2:07\nthe attention of the user the most so\n2:09\nhonestly this has done a pretty good job\n2:11\nof kind of choosing which photos to\n2:13\nchoose first anyway this one would\n2:14\ndefinitely be my feature photo just\n2:16\nbecause you know the tall you know\n2:18\ntongue and groove here on the ceiling\n2:19\nyou know it has really good contrast\n2:21\nreally pops you know we have this little\n2:23\naccent fireplace right here as well and\n2:25\nit really highlights you know that the\n2:26\nfurniture is really nice and clean and\n2:28\nit's really just a really good picture\n2:30\nand it's done really well for us this is\n2:31\nactually our first picture on our actual\n2:33\nlisting but you want to pick the best\n2:35\nfive photos that you have and you're\n2:37\ngoing to have anywhere from 30 to 50\n2:39\npictures so what i'll do here next and\n2:41\nlet's just take a look to see what we\n2:43\nhave okay so the next picture that i\n2:44\nwould like to do i'm gonna use this\n2:46\nmaster bedroom photo here it has the\n2:48\nblue borton band wall here that really\n2:50\njust pops out in pictures then i really\n2:51\nlike that to use as my second photo the\n2:53\nnext photo that i'll use here because we\n2:55\nhave the game room in this property this\n2:56\nis another good one just because you\n2:58\nknow shows that it's going to be a fun\n2:59\nenvironment if you have kids that you\n3:01\ncan have your kids go downstairs and\n3:02\nplay and hang out in the game room area\n3:04\nso i think this would be a good third\n3:06\nphoto the next photo that i'm going to\n3:07\nuse is use this you know outdoor area i\n3:10\nthink this is a really cool photo you\n3:11\nknow because people don't want to be\n3:12\nconfined in their space when they go on\n3:15\nvacation i also want to highlight that\n3:16\nthey can have this you know cool little\n3:18\noutdoor deck area where they can just\n3:19\nkind of hang out and chill and then we\n3:21\nneed one more so out of these photos i'm\n3:23\ngoing to use this one right here and\n3:24\nthen for the last photo here i'm going\n3:25\nto use this kitchen again because it\n3:27\nhighlights the tongue and groove it\n3:28\nshows that the kitchen's you know nice\n3:30\nand updated and then we have this long\n3:32\ntable here with this little breakfast\n3:33\nnook so i definitely like these five\n3:34\nphotos and what this will do it's really\n3:36\ngonna highlight your five best moments\n3:38\nin the house and that's how you wanna\n3:39\nthink of it when you choose your photos\n3:41\num this is really important so how this\n3:43\nwill look and i'll show you what it\n3:44\nlooks like on my actual listing so when\n3:46\nyou come in here it's going to have your\n3:47\nmain photo here and then it's going to\n3:49\nhave the other four photos here on the\n3:50\nright where you can you know highlight a\n3:52\nlittle bit more and then they can show\n3:53\nall photos and they can go down here so\n3:55\nat the time of this recording airbnb has\n3:56\nactually updated their algorithm and\n3:59\nwhen you go to the front page now this\n4:01\nis what it looks like so it doesn't have\n4:03\nany of the titles here it basically just\n4:04\nshows you where the airbnb is located\n4:07\nand then you can come in here and you\n4:08\ncan search by national parks cabins so\n4:10\nyou can't be unique with the listing\n4:12\ntitle anymore but that doesn't mean that\n4:13\nit's not important i'm just going to\n4:15\ncome in here and just kind of copy what\n4:16\ni've done with my one of my other\n4:17\nlistings here so you want to just make\n4:19\nit unique you know it's kind of\n4:20\nhighlight a few things because when the\n4:21\nperson actually clicks on your listing\n4:23\nthen you'll be able to see your title\n4:25\nbut when you're actually searching for\n4:26\nproperties you won't be able to see it\n4:28\njust shows you the location of where\n4:30\nit's at so you want to highlight the\n4:31\nvibe of your place so if it's unique\n4:33\nstylish you can just pick those and then\n4:35\nyour description is going to be really\n4:36\nimportant as well this is where you can\n4:38\nyou know tell a story about you know\n4:40\nwhat exactly your listing is going to do\n4:42\nand you know we have some examples that\n4:43\nyou can use on our listings that will\n4:45\nshare essentially what you want to do\n4:46\nthe format that we like to take here so\n4:48\nwe'd like to have you know a quick you\n4:50\nknow three sentence high level overview\n4:52\nof what you'll be experiencing if you\n4:53\ncome to our property and then we'd like\n4:55\nto do a bullet point list of all of the\n4:57\nthings that we offer and then we also\n4:59\ncome in here and just kind of describe\n5:00\neach uni if they want to dig a little\n5:02\nbit deeper into each part of the house\n5:03\nthey can just come in here and read all\n5:05\nthis so again you can copy this if you\n5:06\nwant and just kind of make it your own\n5:08\nright so so for here you know we don't\n5:10\nwant to worry about pricing in airbnb we\n5:12\ndo all this on price labs which i'm\n5:14\ngoing to share with you in a later\n5:14\nmodule so what you want to do is come in\n5:16\nhere and increase the pricing by at\n5:18\nleast three times what you normally\n5:19\nwould charge and the reason i do that is\n5:21\nonce you hit live your listing is going\n5:23\nto start showing up on the algorithm the\n5:25\nalgorithm actually favors people that\n5:27\njust have a brand new listing and it\n5:29\nputs it on the front page and so you\n5:31\ndon't want someone to come in here and\n5:32\nbook your listing at a really great\n5:34\ndiscount that's why 3x the price of what\n5:36\nmy normal base price would be so i can\n5:37\ncome in and update all of our software\n5:39\nautomations and tools and then super\n5:41\nimportant you want to offer this 20\n5:43\ndiscount for your first three guests and\n5:45\nwhat this will do it's gonna start\n5:47\nsnowballing get your reviews that way\n5:48\nyou can get started on a good foot and\n5:50\nreally get your bookings in right away\n5:51\nand again there's two different\n5:52\nstrategies that you can use so what i\n5:54\npersonally like to do is i like to\n5:55\nincrease the price by you know anywhere\n5:57\nfrom 15 to 20 percent of my base pricing\n6:00\nbecause you know when people see that\n6:01\nthey're getting a 20 discount\n6:02\npsychologically even if it's not really\n6:04\na discount they think they're getting a\n6:06\ngreat deal because they see the 20 off\n6:08\nyou can offset the discount by\n6:09\nincreasing your price so essentially\n6:10\nyou're netting the same i've also seen\n6:12\nother people lower the price and get\n6:14\nbookings that way just so they can start\n6:15\ngetting reviews i like to increase my\n6:17\nprice and that the same because i feel\n6:18\nlike your listing is optimized with\n6:20\ngreat photos and a great listing\n6:22\ndescription then you're gonna get\n6:23\nbookings if you're put on the front page\n6:25\nanyway so that's the way i like to look\n6:27\nat it but again that's completely up to\n6:28\nyou so then you wanna you know make sure\n6:30\nthat you come in here and you know if\n6:32\nyou have security cameras you want to\n6:33\nlist that come in here review your\n6:34\nlisting once you're ready publish your\n6:36\nlisting and then go in and unlist it\n6:38\njust because we're going to onboard a\n6:39\ncouple of software automation tools\n6:41\nfirst before we go officially live so a\n6:43\ncouple things to note for the amount of\n6:44\nguests that i allow and\n6:46\nthe rule of thumb that i like to use is\n6:48\ni like to put one person per every 100\n6:50\nsquare feet of your property and also\n6:52\ndepends on the amount of rooms that you\n6:54\nhave and also it's going to depend on\n6:55\ndifferent regulations and laws in your\n6:57\nspecific area some places no matter how\n6:59\nbig it is will only allow you know six\n7:01\nguests or eight guests you have to make\n7:03\nsure you know those regulations and laws\n7:05\ni like to use four mattresses don't use\n7:07\nblow up mattresses because those you\n7:08\nknow can pop they always deflate no\n7:10\nmatter you know how well you take care\n7:12\nof them so you can use floor mattresses\n7:14\num you can also use the pull out couches\n7:16\nit really depends on your area and i'll\n7:18\nshow you what your budget is again\n7:19\ncreating a great listing description is\n7:21\nreally important because it really sells\n7:22\nthe guest on your listing and what i\n7:24\nlike to do is i like to go on the front\n7:26\npage of my area that i'm going to be in\n7:29\nand see what the top performers are\n7:30\ndoing and kind of take inspiration here\n7:32\nand there and make it your own obviously\n7:34\ndon't just copy them verbatim but you\n7:36\nwant to see what the top performers are\n7:37\ndoing and then i know i'm going to get\n7:38\nasked this question as well we like to\n7:40\nuse a strict cancellation policy on ours\n7:42\nand then cleaning fee you want to make\n7:44\nsure that you pad yours anywhere from 15\n7:46\nto 30 percent because the guest is going\n7:47\nto be paying this anyway obviously\n7:49\nthat's going to depend on the cleaner if\n7:50\nyou find a great cleaner that charges a\n7:52\nlittle bit more than what your\n7:54\ncompetition is charging i think it's\n7:56\nworth having them just because you'll\n7:57\nhave less headaches down the line and\n7:59\nagain i always like to pad my cleaning\n8:00\ncosts just because i use that as\n8:02\nreserves for maintenance repairs you\n8:04\nknow anything else that might come up\n8:06\nand also to tip my cleaners as well and\n8:08\nthen another really important thing you\n8:09\nwant to do is you want to charge more\n8:11\nper guest after let's say you know five\n8:14\nto six guests depending on how big your\n8:16\nlisting is and i'll add anywhere from\n8:17\ntwenty to thirty dollars more per night\n8:19\nand what this is going to do this is\n8:21\ngoing to allow you to increase your\n8:22\naverage daily rate just by more guests\n8:24\ncoming in and again people are gonna lie\n8:26\nabout how many guests they're bringing\n8:27\nso you wanna enforce these rules on your\n8:29\nsecurity camera and you wanna see how\n8:30\nmany guests are actually coming in this\n8:32\nis a really easy way to increase your\n8:33\naverage daily rate just because if you\n8:35\nhave you know let's say three more\n8:37\nguests after six that's almost 100 bucks\n8:39\nextra per night that you can charge and\n8:41\nif you have a great listing if you\n8:43\nfollow everything else in this training\n8:45\nyour listing is going to be so optimized\n8:46\nthat people are going to want to book\n8:47\nyour place they're going to pay that\n8:49\npremium to stay at your place so make\n8:50\nsure that you do that so once your\n8:51\nlisting is live you can come in here and\n8:52\nadd a co-host just put that you pay them\n8:54\nzero dollars and obviously you can pay\n8:55\nthem outside of the actual listing but i\n8:57\nwouldn't pay them through airbnb so yeah\n8:59\nso this is how you set that up you can\n9:01\njust add co-hosts and you just add their\n9:03\nemail here",

done you're you're AI people with this [\u00a0\\_\\_\u00a0] chat GPT [\u00a0\\_\\_\u00a0] this scares the [\u00a0\\_\\_\u00a0] out of me what's your people what do you mean your favorite people you whack your routers what have you done yeah super interesting and fascinating language models I don't know if you know what those are but that's the general uh systems that uh on July child GPT and GPT they've been progressing over the past maybe four years aggressively there's been a lot of development GPT one gpt2 gpt3 uh gbt 3.5 and Chad gbt there's a lot of interesting technical stuff that maybe we don't want to get into sure let's get into it well I'm fascinated by it it's a Chad GPT is based on fundamentally on a 175 billion uh parameter neural network that is gpt3 and the rest is what data is it trained on and how is it trained so you already have like a brain a giant neural network and it's just trained in different ways so Chad uh GPT 3 came out about two years ago and it was like impressive but dumb in a lot of ways it was like you would expect as a human being for it to generate certain kinds of text and it was like saying kind of dumb things that were off and you're like all right this is really impressive but it's not quite there you can tell it's not intelligent and what they did with uh GPT 3. 5 is they started adding more and different kinds of data sets there one of them probably the smartest neural network currently is codex which is fine-tuned for programming like it was it was uh trained on code on programming code and when you train a programming code which chat GPT is also you're teaching it something like reasoning because it's no longer information and knowledge from the Internet it's also reasoning you can like logic even though you're looking at code programming code is you're looking at me like what the [\u00a0\\_\\_\u00a0] is he talking about no no no no that's not what I'm looking at I'm looking at you like oh my God but reasoning is a in order to be able to stitch together sentences that make sense you not only need to know the facts that on July those sentences you also have to be able to reason yeah and we think of it we take it for granted as human beings that we can do some common sense reasoning like like this war started at this date and ended at this date therefore it means that uh like the start and the end has a meaning there's a temporal consistency there's a cause and effect all of those things are inside programming code by the way a lot of stuff I'm saying we still don't understand we're like intuiting why this works so well really these are the intuitions yeah there's a lot of stuff they're not clear so Chad so GPT 3. 5 which Chad GPT is likely based on there's no paper yet so we don't know exactly the the details but it was just trained on on code and more data that's able to give it some reasoning then this is really important it was fine-tuned in a supervised Way by human labeling small data set by human labeling of here's what we would like this network to generate here's the stuff that makes sense here's the kind of dialogue that makes sense here's the kind of answers to questions that make sense it's basically pointing this giant Titanic of a neural network into the right direction that aligns with the way human beings think and talk so it's not just using the giant wisdom of uh Wikipedia and just I can talk about what data sets this train on but just basically the internet it was pointed in the wrong direction so this uh supervised labeling allows it to point in the right direction to when it says [\u00a0\\_\\_\u00a0] you're like holy [\u00a0\\_\\_\u00a0] that's pretty smart so that that's the alignment and then they did uh something really interesting is using reinforcement learning uh based on labeling data from humans this that's quite a large data set the task is the following you have this smart DPT 3.5 thing generate a bunch of text and humans label which one seems the best so ranking like you ask it a question of for example you could do uh generate a joke in a style of Joe Rogan right and you have a label that has five options and you have a label as I mentioned dick and [\u00a0\\_\\_\u00a0] I don't know how exactly but uh so you get it to rank the the human label is just over just sitting there there's a very large number of them they're working full-time they're labeling the ranking of the outputs of this model and that kind of ranking used together with a technique called reinforcement learning is able to get this thing to generate very impressive to humans output so it's not actually there's not a significant breakthrough in how much knowledge was learned that was already in gpt3 and there was much more impressive models already trained so it's on the way not just open AI but this kind of fighting fine tuning is called by human labelers plus reinforcement learning you start to get like like where uh students don't have to write essays anymore in high school yeah where you can style transfer like I said uh do a uh Louis CK joke install Joe Rogan or Joe Joe Rogan joke and the style of Lucy K and does an incredible job at those kinds of style transfers you can uh more accurately query things about the different historical events all that kind of stuff how far away are we from something like chat GPT being impossible to detect whether or not it's a person or whether it's chat GPT well it depends who is playing with it I think we're not that far away in terms of capability but in order to use these systems and rather in order to train these systems you have to be a large company and large companies tend to get scared when it's doing interesting stuff really well they tend to want to even currently with chat GPT it's become a lot less interesting interesting spoken in a Bukowski Hunter S Thompson kind of interesting because the companies are kind of censoring it you don't want it to have any kind of controversial opinions you don't want it to be too edgy you don't want it to be real too like if I ask it how do I build the bomb because I want to destroy the world we wanted to prevent that how about how do I uh uh I don't know convince I don't know anything about this but how do I convince a dude or a girl to sleep with me and go like anything I'm just off the top of my head anything you start to get nervous imagine if you're a company how do I want people to use this kind of system right especially because it's basically an assistant that gives you wisdom about the world gives you knowledge about the world you can be like how do I replace a carburetor yeah that's great\"", "input": ""}

{"category": "text_summarization", "instruction": "Can you summarise the below email between Meredith and the Owners using not more than 200 words. Also Refer to Meredith as \"MZ\" and Joshua and Haley as the 'Owners' :\n\nHi Joshua and Hayley,\n\n1. Please find attached a spreadsheet laying out the positions of your expert and the Builder's expert in relation to your claim for defective work and overpayments under the Contract, and the Builder's claim for unpaid variations.\n\n2. You will see from the spreadsheet that your best outcome at hearing (being you win 100% and the Builder does not succeed at all) is that the Builder would be required to pay you $226,979.64 (plus your costs on an indemnity basis from the expiry of your offer on 23 August 2022).\nHowever, the Builder's best outcome (the Builder is 100% successful and you do not succeed at all) would be that you would pay him $54,983.18 (plus his costs on an indemnity basis from the expiry of his offer on 20 May 2022).\nThese amounts take into account the items the experts agree on in their respective reports.\nThe most likely scenario at hearing will be that you will achieve somewhere between those two amounts.\n\n3. Based on the information that we have to date, bearing in mind the experts have not conducted a joint conclave yet, we have conservatively estimated a likely outcome for you at the final hearing would be for the Builder to pay you approximately $150,000-$160,000. This takes into account partial success for your claim and partial success for the Builder's claim. However, as you are aware litigation is inherently uncertain and therefore we can make no representations or guarantees as to what the outcome will be at hearing\n\n4. We also note that the joint expert conclave may very well alter that figure one way or the other. Greg James has advised that he has contacted the expert for the Builder, Peter Shepherd, and they anticipate conducting a conclave on or after 23 March 2023.\n\n5. As you may recall on 23 August 2022, you made an offer for the Builder to pay you $140,000 in full and final settlement of these proceedings. As you are aware that offer was not accepted. Based on our information in paragraphs 3 above and as previously discussed, from a cost protection perspective this offer is below what you are likely to achieve if this matter runs to hearing. Therefore, if you achieve more than $140,000 at final hearing you can still rely on that letter to seek a higher proportion of your costs from the Builder from the date that offer expired.\n\n6. However, we advise that a further review of these figures be undertaken after we receive the joint expert report.\n\n7. I have tried to contact Conrad Curry, the solicitor for the Builder, on a number of occasions since we last spoke but have yet been able to have a conversation with him about the position of the Builder in regards to having informal settlement negotiations. We will continue to reach out to Mr Curry.\n\n8. Going forward based on the above and information to hand you have a number of options.\n\nOption 1\n\nWe wait until after we get the joint conclave report to review the figures again to see if your previous offer is still likely to be beaten at hearing. Then determine whether or not you would like to put on a further offer.\n\nOption 2\n\nWe wait until after we get the joint conclave report to decide whether or not we engage in informal settlement negotiations.\n\nOption 3\n\nWe put on a further offer for the Builder to pay $140,000, in full and final settlement. However, the Builder would also be required to pay your costs on an ordinary basis up to the date of the expiry of this second letter. The compromise is that you would be accepting a lower proportion of your costs from the expiry date of your first offer on 23 August 2022 to the expiry date of the second letter, then you would be entitled to if you relied on your first letter and beat that offer at the final hearing.\n\nOption 4\n\nWe do nothing and rely on the first offer as it stands and proceed to hearing.\n\nPlease review the spreadsheet and feel free to contact us if you would like to discuss it or the above further.\n\nThank you\n\nBest regards\n\nMeredith Ziegler", "input": ""}

in right now and there are areas which are lagging no matter what you try and do you just can't seem to fix it this could be in terms of your energy this could be in terms of anxiety this could be in terms of your career you're not making the steps that you thought you would you're not making the money that you thought you would you're not being the dad the partner the husband that you wanted to be if you're just not showing up as the man that you you thought you would be by now this is going to be really really helpful for you you've probably tried everything under the sun in order to fix it but every time you do something every time you make even an inch of progress something just drags you back down and so you work your ass off again to try and get back up to where you want to be it could be financially it could be with your relationships it could be the way that you look and you make a bit of progress and then something drags you back down again and no matter what happens you just can't seem to get everything that you want if that sounds familiar keep listening because I got something for you which is really really simple and is going to really really uh easily help you fix it so okay so I'll switch over to the iPad right now this is a very very incredibly lifelike drawing of a Summoner Mountain down here is you once again very like flag here is base camp and then up the top is the summit okay oops I just erased that up the top is the summit okay I'm just going to briefly outline these Concepts where you are right now you're on what we call the hamster wheel right where you're constantly working your ass off but it feels like you're not really getting anywhere or you're not getting anywhere as fast as what you should be it feels inefficient and it feels like you have a high level of friction right things are just more difficult than what they should be base camp is where you're at Square zero you're at Ground Zero you're just about to start your climb everything's totally neutral and the Summit is where you want to be this is where you're the ultimate Dad this is where you're the ultimate partner or husband this is where you're making the money you're living your dream life this is where everything is great your Health's incredible your relationships are incredible and your wealth is also so incredible right everything is absolutely on song and that's obviously where you want to be and one of the things that we see that prevents a lot of dudes from actually getting to the summit Step One is they don't know what Summit they're actually climbing what is it that they're working towards a lot of guys get confused because there are so many different Summers that we can climb I mean let's think about it you a lot of guys go out and they chase money they chose huge amounts of money they just want to build a massive amount of wealth a lot of other guys want to chase lifestyle some guys Trace Chase drugs some guys chase women some guys Chase there's so many different things that we can chase but what is absolutely certain is that if you climb up an alternate Summit because remember there are millions of these Summits you've got money up here you've got you know drugs over here you've got women over on another one you've got whatever we've got all these different goals that we can chase all these different Summers that we can chase but if they're not in an alignment with what we actually want when we reach them we're going to be totally unfilled and that's where we climb up one mountain we come back down we climb up another we come back down and we never feel like we're actually getting anywhere so the very first thing that we need to do is we need to get clear on well what is my Summit what do I actually want from this life when I'm old and gray and smelly and my Skin's all falling out and I've got tubes up my ass down my throat up my up my nose there's a machine helping my lungs to pump what do I want to look back on on my life how do I want to have envisioned my life so that's the first thing we need to get really really clear on what do we want our Summit to be then the next thing after that that we need to do is we need to get out of the hamster wheel right we need to get off this world because whenever we're stuck here on the hamster wheel we're just going around and around and around and around in circles and we'll never actually make it up the mountain it'll never happen so the first step is that we need to get from here on the hamster wheel onto base camp and what base camp looks like is this you've got no friction there's nothing holding you back those anchors those things which are just dragging you down all the time you don't have them you have incredible energy you have no anxiety you're managing your stress really well you'll never evade stress completely in life but you'll know how to deal with it you're on point physically mentally and you're clear on the direction that you need to go that is what we call base camp and once you get to base camp that's where you can actually start the ascent at the summit see one of the other big reasons why so many guys never actually make it up this Summit is because they're trying to climb on the biggest climb of their life stressed out anxious with low testosterone terrible energy they just feel awful can you imagine climbing Mount Everest and feeling like that it's never going to happen and see the thing climbing to your goal and climbing to your whole life's purpose which is essentially what your summit is it's the biggest climate you'll ever do in your life and it's permanent if you're trying to do that bad boy with no energy stressed out anxious low testosterone feeling awful you're never going to make it and so what we need to do is we need to get you to base camp first where you're feeling really good and then we can begin the climb and so the next thing once we've got you here at base camp what do you need when you're at base camp you need this you need a map if you don't have a map you're never going to make it up the mountain I don't know if you guys have ever done any mountain climb but I've done a fair bit and so it always helps to learn how to actually get up to the top because if you wing it on the way it's really really slow the next thing that you always need is you need a guide you need a sherpa as such Edmund Hillary Sir Edmund Hillary the man the first man to Summit Mount Everest or the first white man I think that was able to Summit Mount Everest he failed twice before he only got it on the third time do you know the difference between the first two times and the third it's the third time you had some sherpets he had a sherbet tensing Norge was his name right who actually helped him guide guide him all the way up the mountain and so what we need if we're going to get from base camp all the way up to the summit is we need to have a map a plan and we need to have a guide on how you're going to get there when you have those two things that is when you'll be able to get to the summit okay and so this is really really incredibly important so what I want you to take away from from this video is this first of all if you want to get to where you want to be if you want to be able to actually make more money if you want to be able to be a better dad you want to be a better partner you want to be happier you want to be healthy you want to feel better well first of all you need to know what the Summit is you need to know where your summit is you need to know what game you're playing not somebody else's game not society's game not someone says hey you should be a doctor you should be making this amount of money this is how you should be as a dad you need to have exactly three kids what game are you playing so it's the first thing Clarity the second thing after that is we need to get you off the hamster wheel and get you up to base camp because when you're at base camp that's when you can actually get up to the top and the third thing is you need a map and you need a guide and that is how you get there you're not just going to wing it on the way up because as there are going to be obstacles as we all know you need to make sure that you have a plan on how you're going to get to your summit and you need to have someone there who's going to hold you accountable and guide you the whole way okay on that note guys I'll leave you all to it if you have any questions as always feel free to reach out I hope this helps\"\nVideo Summary:",

{"category": "text_summarization", "instruction": "Please summarise the following article in 4 dot points of the critical points\n\nMany animals are known to engage in play\u2014usually large-brained mammals (like humans) and birds. Now scientists think they have observed genuine play behavior in bees, which were filmed rolling small colored wooden balls, according to an October paper published in the journal Animal Behavior.\n\n\u201cThis research provides a strong indication that insect minds are far more sophisticated than we might imagine,\" said co-author Lars Chittka of Queen Mary University of London and author of a recent book, The Mind of a Bee. \"There are lots of animals who play just for the purposes of enjoyment, but most examples come from young mammals and birds.\"\n\nPlay behavior is typically divided into three broad categories, per the authors. Social play involves playful interactions between animals, usually juveniles engaged in play-fighting. For instance, there is anecdotal evidence from prior studies (one dating back to 1820) for social play among ants and young wasps. Locomotor play involves running, jumping, or similar intense and sustained movement that is not associated with a particular purpose. And object play involves manipulation of an object as a toy.\n\nChittka's group conducted a previous study in 2017 in which they showed that bees could be trained to roll little wooden balls in order to receive a reward. But they also noticed instances where the bees opted to roll the balls even when there wasn't an obvious reward or benefit. The balls had been placed in a tunnel that connected the hive to the experimental arena where the food was. Several bees walked over the balls or stopped to roll them on their way back and forth from the food. Chittka et al. wondered if this might be genuine play behavior, and decided to investigate further.\n\nIt's not easy to design an experiment to conclusively demonstrate that bees (or other insects or animals) are engaged in play behavior specifically. It's not like you can just ask the bees if they're having fun. Five basic criteria must be met.\n\nFirst, the behavior should not be performed in order to get food, attract a mate, or find shelter. Second, the play behavior should be \"voluntary, spontaneous and rewarding in and of itself,\" instead of being associated with a reward of some kind. Third, the motor actions for the play behavior should be different from the actions performed when searching for food or trying to mate. Fourth, the play behavior is repeated but not stereotyped, in order to differentiate between a one-off occurrence vs. an habitual tic. Finally, the play should be initiated when the subject is relaxed, to distinguish it from stress-related behaviors like pacing or walking, both which are often observed in caged zoo animals.\n\nFor these new experiments, Chittka et al. followed a similar setup. They placed 45 bees in the arena and let them choose to walk along a straight line to a foraging area with food, or wander off that path through an area with colored wooden balls. Even when they were done feeding, most bees (37) chose to roll balls for at least one extra day after, with 29 rolling balls for two extra days after feeding. Individual bees rolled balls between 1 and 117 times across the duration of the experiment, with the latter number suggesting at least some of the bees found the activity rewarding.\n\nIn a second experiment to help determine whether this qualified as play, another 42 bees were provided access to two color-coded chambers, one of which was empty while the other always contained wooden balls. Then the balls were removed and the bees were given a choice of which chamber to spend time in. They showed a strong preference for the chamber with a color that was previously associated with the wooden balls. A third experiment revealed that younger bees rolled balls more frequently than older bees, and male bees rolled balls for longer duration than female bees.\n\nAll in all, the authors argue that the behavior of the bees in their experiments met the five basic criteria for play. \u201cIt is certainly mind-blowing, at times amusing, to watch bumble bees show something like play,\" said co-author Samadi Galpayage, a graduate student in Chittka's lab. \"They approach and manipulate these \u2018toys\u2019 again and again. It goes to show, once more, that despite their little size and tiny brains, they are more than small robotic beings. They may actually experience some kind of positive emotional states, even if rudimentary, like other larger fluffy, or not so fluffy, animals do.\u201d", "input": ""}

he has an extraordinary energy that he puts toward his opponent trying to destroy him but after the fight they shake hands they say great fight well done but they're able to turn on and turn off that chip on their shoulder and harness that energy so that they can deploy it when it's necessary so for you in whatever your Pursuits are over the next 12 months when you're actually in fight mode act as if you're in fight mode develop a chip on your shoulder and when I say become aggressively aware of your current situation I mean take a pen and a piece of paper and write down everything in your life that you do not want think of everything in your income in your business if you have one in your health in your relationships in your finances everything you have to look at that list and say that I do not want that you have to write a list of reasons as to why you do not want that why specifically don't you want that income why is that Health situation unacceptable anymore why is that relationship no longer serving you why is that absolutely where you do not want to be and then ask yourself why on those questions as well yes it is a negative energy but you're going to put it towards a positive productive outcome and now that you have this list of all of the things that you do not want and why you do not want them Write the opposite on another sheet of paper the exact opposite of that entire list that you created and why you want those things see in our minds it's a lot easier for us to come up with what we don't want than what we do want but the secret here is you have to have a goal that you do want that you are striving towards you want to make a list of those things as well and then you're going to declare all out war on making that happen you're going to say no to absolutely everything in your life that is not moving you closer towards those goals you're going to say no to the relationships the way that you spend your time the way that you operate your business you're going to say no to 99.9 of things that you're currently saying yes to you're probably in a place in your life if you want to get to the next level where you don't want to be and that is because you have been saying yes to all of the things that are keeping you there so we have to start saying no and it's going to be very uncomfortable and as you start saying no yes you will probably lose people out of your life yes you will probably lose circumstances out of your life that is what happens when you want to get ahead of other people to get ahead of other people you cannot be around those other people and you have to lock yourself into full Focus mode into full dark mode success is more about what you say no to than what you say yes to and as you begin executing on these things you're going to be focusing on the fundament rentals not fancy stuff the fundamentals just like any High performing athlete they Master the fundamentals before they move on to the fancy stuff success is not sexy it is not fancy it is doing the boring fundamentals over time one after the other after the other and boring monotonous repetition that's just how it works if you're chasing quick wins get rich quick stuff fast and easy it does not exist and the sooner that you acknowledge that and accept that as truth the sooner that you can lock yourself into focused dark mode and get going on achieving everything that you want in your life before every single game Michael Jordan he wasn't doing between the legs and windmill dunks he started with practicing chest passes chest passes a very kindergarten activity but Michael Jordan understood that the fundamentals are where the game is won so if you are not mastering the fundamentals of communication in your relationships the fundamentals of Finance the fundamentals of your business the fun fundamentals of sales influence marketing whatever it is in your life that you're trying to accomplish if you're not where you want to be you are missing the fundamentals and so they're not sexy that's probably why you're not attracted to them but that is the single biggest separator between those who are where they want to be and those who are not anytime there's something wrong with my sales team where they screwed up a call or they failed to close a deal or they failed to hit a Target it's always one hundred percent of the time a lack of a fundamental and I will tell you it will take a lifetime you have to decide that you're going to go into dark mode and lock yourself in to aggressively pursuing your goals and saying no to everything that does not support it and if you have the guts to do that you will be successful if you do not you will not it will not matter what else you do if you do not master the fundamentals you see the longer the time Horizon that you think on the Richer and more successful you will become poor people think on very short-term time Horizon think of a homeless person he's just thinking where can I get my next meal whereas an Elon Musk is thinking thousands of years into the future in terms of the future of human civilization that's why he is worth multiple billions of dollars and the homeless guy is worth a cheeseburger at best so if you're thinking on daily weekly bi-weekly even monthly time Horizons you need to expand your time Horizon on where you're thinking by a factor of like a hundred you need to think on a lifetime and beyond your lifetime time Horizon if you want to accomplish goals that you look back on your life and go wow I can't believe I achieved that that was an amazing journey that does not happen by accident that happens by deliberate design and getting upset with where you are and saying enough is enough with where I'm at I don't care if you're making a thousand dollars a month or a hundred thousand dollars a month if you want to get to the next level at a thousand dollars a month and you want ten thousand dollars a month you have to be disgusted and absolutely horrifying wide at one thousand dollars a month if you're at a hundred thousand dollars a month and you wanna get to a million a month you have to be disgusted and horrified with one hundred thousand dollars a month there is no other way that you are going to be able to lock yourself into a focused declare all-out war state to get to the next level until you cultivate a calculated hate for where you are current so if you do this over the next 12 months you will be Leaps and Bounds above and beyond your competition but if don't apply this you will probably be exactly where you are if not in a worse spot one year from now if you do not apply what I'm sharing with you in this video so if you like these types of videos just let me know in the comments I can pump these out maybe one or two a week and they're a little bit easier for me to produce let me know if you'd like me to do that and like it if you like this video and enjoy the rest of your day

Fitness - YouTube\"\nTranscript: \"what's going on welcome to rbt resistance band training i'm james grage and today we're going to talk about how to get started with resistance band training the first thing that i want to jump into and this is one of the more common questions that i get is the difference between a flat or loop style power band which is what a lot of people call this versus a tube style resistance band where you see then it's got all these attachments here on the end and handles now when i first started working out with resistance bands about 11 years ago this is how i started with these tube style bands and then through the years i end up migrating over to this style which is this power style band and i'll explain to you why and a lot of this has to do with what's called linear variable resistance so what linear variable resistance means is the more that you stretch a band the harder it gets and that's one of the nice things about bands is for example with these under sun fitness bands if i were to hang this one back up you can see that i've got five different levels of resistance those come in a little drawstring bag and so one of the most common questions is well does that mean i only have five levels of resistance in other words if you were to equate that to dumbbells would it be the same as only having five dumbbells and the answer is no and that's because of linear variable resistance so let's jump into that let's talk about what that is and how do you get different levels of resistance using this tube style band as an example there's a few ways that you can increase the resistance by stretching the band more now with these i can stretch the band more by widening my stance so if i stand really narrow you see i've got more band here so it's not stretched as much in my starting position so it's going to be easier here at the beginning or if i want to pre-stretch the band i can widen my stance and now i'm stretching the band creating more resistance so that is the basics of linear variable resistance now there's a couple different ways that you can do it but there's a limitation with these and that is because of the handles themselves so it's nice and convenient to have these handles to grab onto but it also eliminates one of the ways that you can create different levels of resistance if we go over here to the loop style band so if i stand on this anchor it under my feet the exact same way i can grab this at the top like this or if i want more resistance and if i want to adjust it in incremental levels i can just grab further down on the band and create more resistance go even further down pre-stretch it more and create even more resistance and i can keep doing that so i've got almost i'm not going to say unlimited levels of resistance but i've got so many different variations and that's why when people ask well what is the equivalent resistance level in one of these bands compared to free weights and the first thing i say is depends on how much you stretch it so for example with the extra light band this has a range of about 5 to 15 pounds again the difference between 5 pounds versus 15 is how much you stretch it when we come over to the light band we've got 20 to 35 pounds of resistance coming to a medium band 30 to 50 pounds of resistance the heavy band roughly 40 to 80 pounds of resistance and then we come into the monster here this is the extra heavy and we've got anywhere from 50 to 120 pounds of resistance so let's talk about all those ways that we can adjust the resistance level so you saw two ways already one is our foot position how wide is our stance and how much are we stretching the band the second one is adjusting our hand position which is why i like these flat style bands because i have more flexibility than i do with a tube style but the other way is adjusting the distance from our anchor point so that takes us into the next topic which is anchored exercises versus unanchored exercises so if anyone's following the ta2 program which stands for train anytime train anywhere which is the program that i developed using resistance bands in the first month of the program we do unanchored exercises meaning that we're anchoring the band with our own body the reason i do that is it's giving you a foundation of exercises that you can do anywhere you don't need a doorway you don't need to anchor it to a pull-up bar all you need is your own body so you could do this on the beach you could do it on top of a mountain you could do it on the moon if you wanted to if you can get to the moon so let's talk about anchored exercises so those are unanchored meaning we're using our body now anchored exercises meaning we're anchoring it to something so there's a couple ways to do that the first reach over here this is a door anchor and this is a really awesome little tool and if you look at this on one side it's got a round piece of foam with a hard plastic core in it that the strap runs through and on the other side is a loop now we can use any door i've got a fake door here yes i have a fake door in the studio i'm going to come over here and show you how this works so open the door and you put the soft foam side through the door keep the strap nice and flat and you're going to shut the door now i do recommend doing it the opposite way that i just did it meaning it's better to anchor on the side of the door that closes and that way when you're pulling on this there's no chance of the door coming open you're actually pulling the door shut which is what you want to do so don't really have a choice here so that is step one if you do have to anchor it on the side of the door that opens make sure you lock the door eliminate that risk of this thing coming open so now we take a band we run it through the loop and then we run it through itself it's called the lark knot and that is how we anchor the band now we can come over we can do all sorts of different exercises exercise i can do rows i could do biceps here and depending on where we anchor the band we can get different angles so for example right here we've got something that's close to chest height if i were to put it over the top of the door now we can do things like triceps push downs we can do lat pull downs anything from a high angle and of course we can do the opposite we can go low and we can do biceps curls different things now here's one of the things common questions that i get they say well how do i keep the door anchor first from sliding up and down the door so if you're doing a high anchor point and you're pulling down you don't want to do it on the side of the door because as you pull of course it's going to want to slide down same thing if you're anchoring low it's going to want to pull up so anchor over the top of the door or go underneath the door so make sure any of those low points or high points are going to the top of the door bottom of the door anything else you can go if it's pretty much from let's say mid thigh to shoulder height then you're definitely going to want to anchor it on the side of the door now going back to what we were talking about with linear variable resistance just wanted to show you the door anchor here our third way of creating more resistance again is stretching the band but now we're going to do it by distancing ourselves from our anchor point so the further i step away the more i stretch the band so now i'm creating more resistance let's say that i'm in the middle of my set and i get to five reps i go ah that's too hard all i have to do two things one i can step forward therefore lessening the resistance now i can finish my set or the other thing that i can do is i just let a little bit of the band slip through my hand and i can adjust again is stretching the band but now we're going to do it by distancing ourselves from our anchor point so the further i step away the more i stretch the band so now i'm creating more resistance let's say that i'm in the middle of my set and i get to five reps i go ah that's too hard all i have to do two things one i can step forward therefore lessening the resistance now i can finish my set or the other thing that i can do is i just let a little years ago and that's why i prefer these over the tube style bands okay now there's a couple variations when it comes to adjusting our foot position or hand position so let me show you those real quick so let me grab this extra light band now a lot of the big guys are like what am i going to use an extra light band for but trust me if you use it the right way for certain exercises this band is very helpful i use this band a lot so here's a good example let's say we want to do side raises for shoulders here when it comes to side raise i don't just want resistance in a vertical plane ideally i would like resistance at this angle right here so what i can do if i'm going to do it on my right side anchor it under my right foot now i'm going to step on it with my left grab it with my right now look at this angle of pull right here so not only am i adjusting my resistance level but i can change the direction of it which is one of the nice things about resistance band training again is having resistance in different planes now if i take bands again whether i anchor them over there on the door or use a a pull-up bar same thing i can change my angle of pull now as i curl this up right there at the peak of the contraction i've got maximum resistance and that's what you want when you're building muscle you want to activate as many muscle fibers as possible and so that's why those good squeezes at the top it's like an isometric contraction are very important and having maximum resistance at the peak of that contraction is really important so each side and you say well i'm ready to jump up and so you put another plate on each side and that's 225 well we can do the same thing with bands and that's simply just adding bands together and all you want to do try to lay them as flat as possible but don't try to micromanages it's not a big deal if there's little twists in them you just anchor them under your feet and there you go now you just increase the resistance level and now you have even more flexibility because you can do the same things is why i recommend gloves now i went 20 plus years of working out in the gym with free weights never ever using gloves when it comes to resistance bands i always use them because just the texture of them as they stretch it creates a lot of friction so you don't want to take the skin off your hand as far as style of glove look you can go to any auto parts store you can get full fingered gloves and they'll work i actually designed a set of gloves here that has padding on the inside of the thumb and the outside when it comes to these tube style bands it's a double-edged sword like most things in life the handles are convenient they're nice but by the time you add up the handles the metal rings the metal carabiners through all your different levels of resistance it adds a lot of weight and i found that when i was using these they were too bulky and they were too heavy one of the things i like about these especially with the five different levels of resistance which is all i've been working out with for the sometimes it's difficult to juggle all those things and fit your work out into your schedule so let's imagine it's a long day you didn't get your workout in the morning you tell yourself all day long i'm gonna go to the gym in the afternoon but all of a sudden five o'clock rolls around you go home you go you change your clothes put your gym clothes on you go oh man i gotta get in the car i gotta drive to the gym so for me the 15 minutes of driving to the gym and then parking and the 15 minutes driving something this big and clunky and heavy i wanted light and uh and compact so moving on so we covered linear variable resistance what that is and what the resistance levels are how to adjust the resistance level which brings me to the next common question which is where do i start which band do i pick up you know do i do i start my biceps exercises with the heavy do i go to the extra heavy best advice i can give you is you need to change the way that you think one of the common mistakes that i see people making a gym so even if you're and you take yourself to fail you're only using good form not at the cost of doing cheat reps in bad form but now conversely what if you come in the next week and you feel stronger than the previous week you did 10 reps last week but now all of a sudden you get to 10 and you feel like you've got you know maybe three reps left in your gas tank do you just stop at 10 no you keep going you push yourself and that is training by feel that's learning to know what your limits are and pushing yourself to that benefits of the linear variable resistance and being able to adjust on the fly because you can start off harder if you want to let's say you're going for 10 reps do the first five and do them really hard and if you can't get the rest like i said adjust your your foot position or your distance to anchor point or your hand position lessen the resistance a little finish out your set but finish it strong so those are all the key points with getting started with resistance bands now there's a lot of questions of how bands compare to gym what do you need well you need a bench why because with free weights you only have one plane of resistance which is the vertical plane because we are pressing against gravity so in other words to train our chest we have to lay on our back so we can press straight up with bands we don't need that because we have resistance in multiple planes because the resistance or the tension created isn't from gravity but it's from the band itself so now we can stand up and we can press in front of us we can press up above we strength this is a functional strength and that's one of the things that i really like about resistance bands\"", "input": ""}

will be more or less clearly understood by the study of the seasons winter summer spring and these things have all to do with a magnetic factor in the air and we think of it only as in trying to explain it as a physical astronomical phenomena since there's the rotation and Revolutions of the Sun and planets but each of these planets is a field of magnetic energy and this energy comes to us through what we call Air [Music] now what is air actually well we have scientific definitions of it but there's something more to it than that air is something in itself it is a substance it is not only a condition of climate or of weather it is a basic factor in the contributions which make up existence one thing we have learned from television is that air transmits we know for instance that we can have all kinds of programs on the air at the same time and they can come from all directions and they can overlap and interlap but each one will remain separately identified as though it was moving in a Channel or Circuit of its own you can have a dozen programs if you turn them on turn them off but none of those programs is going through the air in the form we see it and we see the murder committed on the screen and we see it broadcast into a theater somewhere or into a home but it isn't the murder that's going into the home if the murder has not been visible when it went through the air something went through was vibration and this vibration in the magnetic field can be divided into an infinite complexity of separate emanation in other words if we had a thousand different channels they could be differentiated in the magnetic fields so that each one would be broadcast correctly and properly for whatever it is thus we realize there's something out there besides air something beside helium and oxygen something beside the ordinary factors we take into consideration scientifically we are in the presence of a mysterious agent an agent that is part of everything that we are now studying magnetism as it comes into the human body we discover along with Kilda that each human body is surrounded by an etheric of energy field this energy field is sometimes referred to as an aura but it is not the true order that we think of in metaphysics this magnetic field is an area of energy this area of energy it forms an egg-like atmospheric sheath around the physical body usually extending three to five feet from it in each Direction this energy Fields is the basis of virtue because this energy field Depends for its reality its serviceability and its protecting power to mood emotion thought and the attitudes of the person around which this magnetic field is gathered in other words the individual if they are normal if mentally emotionally and physically they are keeping the rules this magnetic field forms a tremendous protection it is normal it is healthy it is constantly able to handle infections and all kinds of difficulties it will help to heal wounds it will help to recover the use of functions and organs and if we are deprived of some part of the body it will try to compensate for us as long as the individual takes proper care of his magnetic field it will serve him now this is by phase of morality that is generally overlooked it is assumed that these magnetic fields are something you don't pay much attention to but the truth of the matter is the whole survival of the individual depends upon maintaining the Integrity of this flow of energy into the magnetic field this energy comes from the sun it comes through a mysterious energy tube in the magnetic field it enters the individual through the crown of the head it disseminates through the entire body and it's excreted back again through the lower centers of the body and is reclansed by the solar energy this is a kind of a little private tank or capsule of life that we are all caring about with us all the time now the problem of Morality In this is very definite the moment we break rules we damage that magnetic flow we have got to keep the laws of nature and these in turn are the laws of God or the magnetic field fails it can fail because of physical interferences which reduce its integrity and reduce its power it can be wasted in riotous living which is such a common cause these days it can be variously destroyed by moods by Attitudes by fears by complexes it can be destroyed or damaged by alcohol drugs narcotics all kinds of things but if this field is damaged it immediately reacts into Health it damages the individual's Vitality it makes him more easily subject to contagions and infections and it definitely shortens the life expectancy now if this is the soul why do we want to consider it as a moral Factor in other words what is morality to the Ancients it was obedience to the word the words of God or the laws of God in more modern times with more intelligent people it is obedience with the evident will of deity as manifested in creation virtualize in whatever builds up the magnetic fields Vice is that which tears them down no human interception can interfere with this in any way therefore if we are good is not because the book says we should be is not because it was funded by the laws on Sinai it is because we keep the rules of the integration of the human structure that we use the magnetic fields correctly and protect our health and our happiness and our well-being in that way now we think of the magnetic field of surrounding the entire structure of the body as kilna shows in his work on the human atmosphere and have it also in his study of the atom this however is only a phase of it each part of the body has a magnetic field each unit within the individual has its survival in a unit of energy and this unit of energy is present in the smallest subdivision of imaginable space it is in the tiniest atom there is no such a thing as a dead particle in the universe even if it is killed by something the very disintegrating process is a symbol of Life Energy therefore we have confronted with the natural problem of realizing that virtue is to keep the law of the energy field now the law of the energy field just by coincidence is also the law of integrity the energy field is what establishes right and wrong the energy TPL tells us that to lose our disposition and temporary fit is wrong to use various negative destructive attitudes is wrong to compromise the principles of right living is wrong to think badly to feel unpleasantly to be engaged in any action or concept which is contrary to the common good damages the magnetic field and therefore is wrong the stomach has its own magnetic field the stomach is not simply an organ it is an organism it is a living thing within the human body the same is true of the heart the brain the glandular structure all the organs the intestines all the motor system the nervous system the endocrine system these are all entities they are entities of magnetic unities they are part of living organisms that you're cooperating together for the common good to abuse one is to damage all to neglect one is to neglect all each of these organs has its own field in the body and all these fields together constitute the grand magnetic field that surrounds the complete person now then we go inside of this for a moment to see what we're dealing with so we go back to Pythagoras who was very timely in that he tells us that in Egypt there was a temple in which therapy was a result of this contemplation of a symmetrical geometric solids in other words the images of therapy were mathematical cubes octagons each one placed upon a kind of all a pedestal for the contemplation of the Sephora all the symmetric geometric solids perfect and complete instructor to look upon them was therapeutic because look to look upon them accepted their energy as a reality in our lives now these Stone solids apparently were not alive they only gave the impression of value but actually they were alive every form in nature natural or artificial has a magnetic field from the tiniest atom to the greatest galaxy the magnetic fields are present and the rules of each of them must be obeyed now if an individual looking at a geometric solid C is in it a perfect proportion this realization enters into the subconscious life of the person the imagery of that solid is sent into the Consciousness in the form of a benevolent magnetic Center it means that the individual is seeing Harmony is seeing something in perfect order and perfect correctness wherevers we see Perfection it improves ourselves wherever we accept Discord is inevitable it injures ourselves everywhere looking around us in nature we see that all natural things are benevolent it is only when these are abused mostly by Humanity that these benevolences are lost we live in a completely corrupt world therefore we are bewildered we are intimidated we are worried and very often just simply give up and follow the line of least resistance and go down with the rest now this isn't really the way it was intended to be actually the the bad news that we have has nothing to do with us unless we're part of the bad program now you might say it's nicer to imagine a world in which we could all work together there's no doubt about it there'll be much better but until such time the individual who is trying to be right has got to be careful that he is not infected by a common disillusionment he cannot afford to say everything is wrong and mean it he's got to hold inside of himself a realization the principle is the basic value and that regardless of what happens in the world he cannot lose sight of protecting his own energy resources because it might just so happen that he could be one of those who could help to change the course of history in other words disillusionment despair discouragement bitterness anger frustration all these do nothing to the person against whom they are turned but they do everything to the individual who uses them therefore no matter what we read in the inside of himself a realization the principle is the basic value and that regardless of what happens in the world he cannot lose sight of protecting his own energy resources because it might just so happen that he could be one of those who could help to change the cours can't do it badly and be well off but until such time values never change never will we be punished what somebody else does never will we be rewarded for the virtues of others we must achieve these things ourselves through our own efforts through our own integrities and through our own dedications and all of this is added up in a mysterious bank account which is called energy or magnetic resource it is there to serve us it is there to serve the individual who does wrong but if the individual does wrong the service collapses and the that his own honesty is his only will all else is some kind of a delusion which will ultimately turn back and with him so in the quiet Dune and peace of the realization of the immutability of good the inevitability of right or wrong the endless and continuous process of redemption going through every area of nature all things in due time will we come back into the peace which they sacrificed when they tried to put self as an individual above Universal reality as we look around us there's every reason to know that we live in a resources will be reduced we're worried now about changes taking place in the atmosphere that the overload that we are throwing against our natural resources is beginning to endanger us we cannot afford to waste the magnetic field of the body or destroy it any more than we can afford to destroy the one of the earth if we are going to run out of petroleum someday we're also going to run out of the ability to recuperate from ailments if we dispose of and waste our recuperative power the magnetism which magnetism because it's magnetism in the food that feeds us it's magnetism in the air that we breathe is a magnetism in the earth that grows our vegetables and it is magnetism in our souls it makes us hope for good all the things we not all the things we believe in are energy dependent and the use of energy is the most important thing why we go on year after year making all kinds of efforts to feel better be better or think better and Overlook the one fact that everything that we think and feel and believe depends upon a life weed we have been given a beautiful planet we subdivide it and sold it for profits the original purpose was that we should become a wonderful group of human beings working together for the good of each other and the glory of the universe we are being prepared for a bigger job than we have when we are flunking the examination at the present moment we are not doing what we should do everything that comes along is measured in profit everything it comes along is majored in Freedom from responsibility when energy is something that we must be all these things are all little things but they all add up to the loss and waste of magnetic resource they are the failure of the individual to protect the source of his own life the source of his own future and the breaking of the laws and rules by which he must compare his own needs with the needs of others it is only when we work to protect the Toadstool as well as the nation that we can have peace in the world we must protect the small things because each of them is a run energy resource the protection of them is games out of them silly games games in which we think we're conquering everything but by putting something in orbit it's not all true and what really we are looking for is to realize that we conquer or we win or we achieve our goal when we put ourselves in orbit and we get back again into the rules of the game of Life serve it as it should be served love as it should be loved admire the good protect it and slowly and quietly outgrow everything that is less if we can do that then these resources these magnetic fiel\"", "input": ""}

what it takes to run an agency and today in this video it's [ \\_\\_ ] Christmas for you guys Merry Christmas first name I got you a dildight today we have a proud member of 300 agencies his name is Samuel Darby he runs an agency making around a million dollars a year he has around 40 clients he's in the construction repair and Roofing Niche and if there's any video about smma right now that you should be watching to the end it's this one because Samuel is literally gonna go inside his ad account show the exact ads he's running to get his own clients a little bit about how he runs his agency from the inside he's just literally doing a screen share showing everything so I dare you watch this video to the end especially when Samuel dives into the detailed Frameworks on how he gets his clients so that being said you guys are in for the best video of your life I'm not even joking so cue the interview alright guys so we're here with Sam he has an agency in the roofing space uh has around 40 clients is that right yeah anyway from 35 to 40. um yeah and in this video he's gonna break down um how his agency a little bit about how his agency works and how he actually gets results for his clients so yeah take it away yeah cool um so we're actually not just Roofing so we do we do have some Roofing clients but it's mainly um like you UK Home Improvements companies so we always focus on one product at a time so we've got anywhere any one time we've got anywhere from 25 to 40 companies kind of a bit High a bit on the higher end um now but over the last kind of year or two it's kind of climbed from uh 10 to 15 clients up to 40. and um we do products like into Conservatory insulation very boring products resin installation um you know home exterior wall Coatings insulation that kind of stuff very boring products but all the values between sort of 3020 to 25 000 pounds and um um this is a great industry to be in because obviously the clients that we work with are um they need the work continuously coming in so we essentially provide them with work so we I think in 2021 we had about 25 to 30 clients average across the year and I think we generated about 15 to 20 million pounds worth of revenue for them and that was um so it worked out somewhere in the region like yeah like 45 to 55 000 per month per client uh which obviously if you're working in like a dental or um any other market like a local market you're just not going to have numbers that large yeah because construction and Home Improvements the trade industry is uh you're working with larger order values the numbers are much more kind of inflated but obviously the margins are like um 20 so if you're selling a five grand roof it's like a 1 000 pound margin so obviously bear that in mind um but yes we've got one side of our business which is the um agency side and it's I think quite similar to Thomas what you guys do it's retainer based mainly I think you guys have a weird performance on the front end so the first month's like performance kind of weighted so we kind of um we have like 30 day guarantees based on performance so we do we do get paid up front but um we've been going now for like four years and we've got like 40 video testimonials like seven figure video testimonials multiple six figure video testimonials so like it's a lot easier now for me to take money off up front for people um it used to be a little bit weighted on the back end but now we've got that kind of credibility and it's a lot end so the first month's like performance kind of weighted so we kind of um we have like 30 day guarantees based on performance so we do we do get paid up front but um we um we buy any car like all of these kinds of companies are kind of front-end Brands then um work with Partners on the back end so for example we started working with an insulation company um we're selling them on a PowerPoint basis so we cover all the advertising costs all the marketing costs we run all the ads we design all the funnels we um film all the content produce all the ads and we actually do I can go into more about that in a minute but we do a lot of the content ourselves and then we then use like a lead distribution your viewers are like getting started maybe a big beginning stages you're always going to make if you're good at what you do you're always going to make more money on a performance model um it's a lot easier for them to trust you yeah because you're selling something that they don't have yet and you're kind of guaranteeing you're going to deliver it so it's a lot easier for you to make more money and there are oftentimes a lot happy to give that money over once you've helped them you see your website why you're able to get clients you just have like the video sales letter which is like very short like we can guarantee you um basically results and then you have like like a long list of testimonials like really good testimonials where you have people saying they've had an excellent experience with you they've made like this amount of money um so yeah I mean let's go through your website I think that could be very useful for people okay cool if you said enable screenshot I'll do that now oh yeah my bad I think me see if I can put it up um I'll see if I can pull it up I might be able to it's crazy you have to search up ad accounts oh do you not have to do that anymore no um like you have so many you have to like search one up oh yeah yeah I mean it's probably 100 in there yeah um so yeah so we've spent this isn't all that account it could disabled as you can see out to um oh it sounds looks like it maybe isn't disabled anymore but anyway it I can't use it um we spent like 76k we've got a new one know into I would say 70 80 of our clients have come from Facebook as now it's a lot more word of mouth and a lot more kind of we brought that reputation up we get more organic traffic and we also have a big email database that we can um you know run like email broadcast like case study so the easiest way to get clients is like if you've got a once you've been going a little while and you've built up a little bit of an email email database I think a lot of agencies seek on email like we've got 4 000 yeah and are those emails coming from those fit from the Facebook ads you're running um yeah also yeah so the email options you mean yeah yeah so let me uh let me pull up some examples so uh so we kind of yeah we kind of swept swapped um funnels we kind of alternate between strategies but if anyone who knows Facebook ads this is obviously a like a lead opt-in funnel I'll show you the ad I don't mind um but this one we spent like 5K um 1800 email opt-ins and this was probably the longest one we had running sales which is like completely true um I just basically went through our clients and picked handpicked the top five to ten Facebook ads like creatives that just like blew up and each one of them got like 100 leads so um it links to a yeah really simple opt-in page like this with a bit of a sales script um once they then download this they put their email address in download um that goes straight to my email um convertkit account so I can then I send them into like a 10 email um I guess sales script like what's that like a simple survey Builder um so I find that information about them like you know size of business how many teams they've got what their problem is what their revenue was it's really important to me if they've revenue is like under 300 000 and they don't you know it doesn't fit certain kind of criteria I will just cancel the course pin off um so I'm really looking for those companies that have revenues that are well north of 300 000 ideally north of a million but so I kind of hand-picked that actually if I can show it to you so if I pull up that and go high level I use pretty much the same kind of go high level snapshot for myself as I leave for our clients because it's very basic it's like an a simple pipeline yeah and each stage of the pipeline the leads kind of get contacts in different ways so if I go to yes right this is my 2. them all in here so I've gone to demo call I'll book in the slot and then once that's booked in that lead automatically moves over to demo book section so um and um and then from there and then just I kind of moved into the process but on that demo as a zoom demo and I kind of rather than having like a PDF a lot of times I would be especially with this industry might be a bit different for whoever whoever's listening if you're working with a relatively sophisticated market then it's gonna be people do this because like it's so much easier to just say to them hey if you just scroll down you can like they might say to you oh do you have any examples of this but yeah cool just scroll down that page and they can just scroll down like as a salesperson especially in the service space you need to be ready for any um sort of situation if they're if they say you might get on a call and you're like oh man I could definitely close this call right now I don't need a demo in which case I'll say to them hey uh the service which is just like campaign build um I I you know Custom Sales page back in Sales Systems um I kind of break down because we use go ahead level for our clients performance tracking as well so I I can do this because I'm not going to be giving away any personal data by doing this but if I go for example into a customer here if I did it's good because with high level you have um the tracking like the reporting that's done for them like um yeah you don't have to you don't have to get your media buyer to like report it sounds about right to be honest um but certainly yeah at a glance I can kind of look at this and see all the important stuff and it's actually really easy when you're if you're trying to close deals and let's say you've got a handful of clients that are making real serious money if you have a way of tracking that Revenue in either a Google sheet a go high level um and it's legit so when you get on demo calls if I get a demo call with a company that's and I qualified yeah you can just transparently show them like information you you show the product you give them the timelines I'm like cool basically this stuff doesn't really matter like it's why there's not much information here they just they just need to see it like they need to see it so they can see what you do it doesn't really matter at the end of the day it's about performance so really I'm focused on saying to them look it's at the end of the day we're gonna fill your calendar with the amount of appointments that you need to hit the didn't make at least their money back in profit after their costs after their cost of um installation and materials um we give them a full refund of their fee so it's more or less like no-brainer um and it's I look at the guarantee less of like a marketing tactic for me personally more of like a closing closing tactic so um I kind of wait till the end of that call before I even mention it and then I mention it at the end and then it's like a no-brainer so um closing retainers for us now is easy started with this particular company it's like I don't know three weeks and uh we get paid 150 per appointment and we're just starting to ramp it up now so uh this is like the direction we want to go in which is taking all the risk obviously you have to have the cash flow to do this um yeah but no I think it's it's a good idea because you can eliminate you know the the pressure of like being behind your staff in like delivering on the guarantee every single month especially if you have a money back guarantee or differently so I mean it's simple facts is who who's going to win the deal if you're going in saying to them hey um it's two grand a month um I don't have much experience but hit me up front there's no guarantee yeah I can't guarantee anything and it's a three month commitment versus me or you or anyone who's going and saying hey um we guarantee you're gonna make at least 30k of sales um here's 30 people that I've done exact same thing as you the exact same product phone myself like to understand these products and really know how to Market them properly so and also I've gone to video shoots and I've filmed products and I've um we have our own brand that we advertise and stuff like that so like I know this industry super well now um and Alex from Rosie once said it for anyone who knows who Alex Mosey is he said um something along the lines of how do you actually expect how you can't complain about your clients performance if you haven't done it yourself yeah the um I think this was absolutely insane do you have you said you were gonna start a channel right I think um I think a bunch of people are gonna want to see that so um yeah I'm gonna leave I'm Gonna Leave a link in the description for your channel and um yeah what what type of content um do you have to promote on there or do you have to you know what are you gonna be uh releasing yeah no worries um I'll stop the share so I am I have a tick tock account which has I don't know I think I have like 40 000 subscribers or Tock account which is my Tick Tock Samuel dot Darby and my YouTube is also oh no my Instagram and my YouTuber both the Samuel Darby so you can catch me on on all of those um yeah more content coming soon for sure all right it was nice talking with you man and um yeah uh maybe maybe we'll do this again I don't know um yeah cool all right bye

{"category": "text_summarization", "instruction": "summarise the following text into bullet points: Ouch. Sounds like you're having a tough time max. That sucks. I've been there, so I kinda know what you're talking about. I've been in the ever circling vortex of self doubt, frustration, and loathing. It's no bueno. I know. If you don't mind lemme tell you a couple things. You can read em if you want, read em again later if you feel like it. But honestly man, if I spend all this time typing this out to you and you don't let it be a little tinder for your fire, well, you're just letting us both down. And you don't HAVE to do that. You don't HAVE to do anything. But you get to choose.\n\n(Who am I? My name\u2019s Ryan and I live in Canada. Just moved to a new city for a dream job that I got because of the rules below. I owe a lot of my success to people much cooler, kinder, more loving and greater than me. When I get the chance to maybe let a little bit of help out, it\u2019s a way of thanking them. )\n\nRule numero uno - There are no more zero days. What's a zero day? A zero day is when you don't do a single fucking thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on. No more zeros. I'm not saying you gotta bust an essay out everyday, that's not the point. The point I'm trying to make is that you have to make yourself, promise yourself, that the new SYSTEM you live in is a NON-ZERO system. Didnt' do anything all fucking day and it's 11:58 PM? Write one sentence. One pushup. Read one page of that chapter. One. Because one is non zero. You feel me? When you're in the super vortex of being bummed your pattern of behaviour is keeping the vortex goin, that's what you're used to. Turning into productivity ultimate master of the universe doesn't happen from the vortex. It happens from a massive string of CONSISTENT NON ZEROS. That's rule number one. Do not forget.\n\nLa deuxieme regle - yeah i learnt french. its a canadian thing. please excuse the lack of accent graves, but lemme get into rule number 2. BE GRATEFUL TO THE 3 YOU'S. Uh what? 3 me's? That sounds like mumbo jumbo bullshit. News flash, there are three you's homeslice. There's the past you, the present you, and the future you. If you wanna love someone and have someone love you back, you gotta learn to love yourself, and the 3 you's are the key. Be GRATEFUL to the past you for the positive things you've done. And do favours for the future you like you would for your best bro. Feeling like shit today? Stop a second, think of a good decision you made yesterday. Salad and tuna instead of Big Mac? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Was yesterday a nonzero day because you wrote 200 words (hey, that's all you could muster)? THANK YOU YOUNGER ME. Saved up some coin over time to buy that sweet thing you wanted? THANK YOU. Second part of the 3 me's is you gotta do your future self a favour, just like you would for your best fucking friend (no best friend? you do now. You got 2. It's future and past you). Tired as hell and can't get off reddit/videogames/interwebs? fuck you present self, this one's for future me, i'm gonna rock out p90x Ab Ripper X for 17 minutes. I'm doing this one for future me. Alarm clock goes off and bed is too comfy? fuck you present self, this one's for my best friend, the future me. I'm up and going for a 5 km run (or 25 meter run, it's gotta be non zero). MAKE SURE YOU THANK YOUR OLD SELF for rocking out at the end of every.single.thing. that makes your life better. The cycle of doing something for someone else (future you) and thanking someone for the good in your life (past you) is key to building gratitude and productivity. Do not doubt me. Over time you should spread the gratitude to others who help you on your path.\n\nRule number 3- don't worry i'm gonna too long didnt' read this bad boy at the bottom (get a pencil and piece of paper to write it down. seriously. you physically need to scratch marks on paper) FORGIVE YOURSELF. I mean it. Maybe you got all the know-how, money, ability, strength and talent to do whatever is you wanna do. But lets say you still didn't do it. Now you're giving yourself shit for not doing what you need to, to be who you want to. Heads up champion, being dissapointed in yourself causes you to be less productive. Tried your best to have a nonzero day yesterday and it failed? so what. I forgive you previous self. I forgive you. But today? Today is a nonzero masterpiece to the best of my ability for future self. This one's for you future homes. Forgiveness man, use it. I forgive you. Say it out loud.\n\nLast rule. Rule number 4, is the easiest and its three words. exercise and books. that's it. Pretty standard advice but when you exercise daily you actually get smarter. when you exercise you get high from endorphins (thanks body). when you exercise you clear your mind. when you exercise you are doing your future self a huge favour. Exercise is a leg on a three legged stool. Feel me? As for books, almost every fucking thing we've all ever thought of, or felt, or gone through, or wanted, or wanted to know how to do, or whatever, has been figured out by someone else. Get some books max. Post to reddit about not caring about yourself? Good first step! (nonzero day, thanks younger me for typing it out) You know what else you could do? Read 7 habits of highly successful people. Read \"emotional intelligence\". Read \"From good to great\". Read \u201cthinking fast and slow\u201d. Read books that will help you understand. Read the bodyweight fitness reddit and incorporate it into your workouts. (how's them pullups coming?) Reading is the fucking warp whistle from Super Mario 3. It gets you to the next level that much faster.\n\nThat\u2019s about it man. There\u2019s so much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days, but that\u2019s not your mission right now. Your mission is nonzero and forgiveness and favours. You got 36 essays due in 24 minutes and its impossible to pull off? Your past self let you down big time, but hey\u2026 I forgive you. Do as much as you can in those 24 minutes and then move on.\n\nI hope I helped a little bit max. I could write about this forever, but I promised myself I would go do a 15 minute run while listening to A. Skillz Beats Working Vol. 3. Gotta jet. One last piece of advice though. Regardless of whether or not reading this for the first time helps make your day better, if you wake up tomorrow, and you can\u2019t remember the 4 rules I just laid out, please, please. Read this again.\n\nHave an awesome fucking day \u263a\n\ntldr; 1. Nonzero days as much as you can. 2. The three you\u2019s, gratitude and favours. 3. Forgiveness 4. Exercise and books (which is a sneaky way of saying self improvement, both physical, emotional and mental)\n\nEdit: Wow reddit gold? Thanks! No idea what to do with it or whats the deal but many thanks!\n\nEdit2: Someone asked what I meant by \"much more when it comes to how to turn nonzero days into hugely nonzero days\". The long and short of it is a simple truth, but it's tough to TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AND PRACTICE. It's this: you become what you think. This doesnt mean if I think of a tree, I'll be oakin' it by august. It means that the WAY you think, the THINGS you think of, and the IDEAS YOU HOLD IN YOUR MIND defines the sum total that is you. You procrastinate all the time and got fear and worry goin on for something? You are becoming a procrastinator. You keep thinking about how much you want to run that 5 k race in the spring and finish a champion? Are ya keeping it in mind all the time? Is it something that is defining your ACTIONS and influencing you DECISIONS? If it is, then you're becoming the champion you're dreaming about. Dreaming about it makes it. Think and it shall be. But do not forget that action is thought's son. Thoughts without actions are nothing. Have faith in whatever it is you've steeled your mind to. Have faith and follow through with action.\n\nOk, Ryan that's a bunch of nice words n shit, but how does that help me turn slightly nonzero days into hugely nonzero days. Do you believe all these words you just read? Does it makes sense to you that you BECOME WHAT YOU THINK OF? Ask yourself: What do I think of? When you get home and walk in the door. (how quickly did you turn that laptop on? Did turning it on make you closer to your dreams? What would?) At the bus stop. Lunch break. What direction are you focusing your intentions on? If you're like I was a few years ago, the answer was either No direction, or whatever caught my eye at the moment. But no stress, forgive yourself. You know the truth now. And knowing the truth means you can watch your habits, read books on how you think and act, and finally start changing your behaviour. Heres an example: Feeling like bunk cause you had zero days or barely nonzero days? THINK ABOUT WHAT YOURE DOING. and change just a little bit more. in whatever positive direction you are choosing to go.", "input": ""}

{"category": "text_summarization", "instruction": "Based on the findings of the assessment from the field, we conducted KIIs and FGDs from three sampled schools in Banaadir, Kismayo, and Baidoa. The issues that emerged include:\nDiscrimination:\nAccording to the information gathered during the qualitative research, adolescent girls living with disabilities face multiple forms of discrimination in their respective communities. \nDuring the qualitative research, several respondents reported experiencing discrimination due to their disabilities. For example, one respondent stated, \"I have faced a lot of discrimination in my life just because I am disabled. People often treat me differently and don't give me the same opportunities as others.\" Another respondent shared, \"I've faced discrimination from my classmates at school, who call me names and make fun of me. It makes me feel like I don't belong there.\"\n These experiences of discrimination can have a negative impact on the confidence and self-esteem of adolescent girls living with disabilities, making it harder for them to access and succeed in education.\n\nSome manifestations of discrimination and related barriers include: \n1. Stereotypes and negative attitudes: Girls with disabilities reported they encounter negative stereotypes and attitudes from members of their community, which leads to discrimination and exclusion. For example, they may be viewed as being less capable or less intelligent than their non-disabled peers. One girl said \"I wish people would see me for who I am, not just my disability. I have so much to offer, but they never give me a chance.\"\n2. Physical barriers: Girls with disabilities reported they face physical barriers in their community that make it difficult for them to access education or other resources. This can include a lack of infrastructure, such as ramps or elevators, to accommodate their mobility needs. One girl said, \"It's hard for me to participate in community activities because the buildings are not accessible for me.\"\n3. Limited opportunities: Girls with disabilities have limited opportunities for education, employment, or participation in community activities due to discrimination and exclusion. One of the participants during the discussion said, \"I want to be able to contribute to society, but it's hard when you're always excluded and discriminated against. It's hard for most of the girls with disabilities to find a job when they complete education. People discriminate against them because of their disability.\"\n\nOverall, it is important to recognize and address these forms of discrimination in order to create a more inclusive and equal society for adolescent girls living with disabilities in Somalia. This may include promoting positive attitudes and understanding towards disability, making necessary accommodations and infrastructure improvements, and ensuring equal opportunities for education, employment, and participation in community activities.\n\nSummarize these findings in bullet points", "input": ""}
{"category": "text_summarization", "instruction": "EZRA KLEIN: You write in that piece, \u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that systems like these pose a real and imminent threat to the fabric of society.\u201d Why? Walk me through what that world could look like.\n\nGARY MARCUS: Let\u2019s say if somebody wants to make up misinformation about Covid. You can take a system like Galactica, which is similar to ChatGPT, or you can take GPT-3. ChatGPT itself probably won\u2019t let you do this. And you say to it, make up some misinformation about Covid and vaccines. And it will write a whole story for you, including sentences like, \u201cA study in JAMA\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s one of the leading medical journals \u2014 \u201cfound that only 2 percent of people who took the vaccines were helped by it.\u201d\n\nYou have a news story that looks like, for all intents and purposes, like it was written by a human being. It\u2019ll have all the style and form and so forth, making up its sources and making up the data. And humans might catch one of these, but what if there are 10 of these or 100 of these or 1,000 or 10,000 of these? Then it becomes very difficult to monitor them.\n\nWe might be able to build new kinds of A.I., and I\u2019m personally interested in doing that, to try to detect them. But we have no existing technology that really protects us from the onslaught, the incredible tidal wave of potential misinformation like this.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve been having this argument with Yann LeCun, who\u2019s the chief A.I. scientist at Meta, and he\u2019s saying, well, this isn\u2019t really a problem. But already we\u2019ve seen that this kind of thing is a problem. So it was something that really blew my mind around Dec. 4. This was right after ChatGPT came out. People used ChatGPT to make up answers to programming questions in the style of a website called Stack Overflow.\n\nNow everybody in the programming field uses Stack Overflow all the time. It\u2019s like a cherished resource for everybody. It\u2019s a place to swap information. And so many people put fake answers on this thing where it\u2019s humans ask questions, humans give answers, that Stack Overflow had to ban people putting computer-generated answers there. It was literally existential for that website. If enough people put answers that seemed plausible but we\u2019re not actually true, no one would go to the website anymore.\n\nAnd imagine that on a much bigger scale, the scale where you can\u2019t trust anything on Twitter or anything on Facebook or anything that you get from a web search because you don\u2019t know which parts are true and which parts are not. And there\u2019s a lot of talk about using ChatGPT and its ilk to do web searches. And it\u2019s true that some of the time. It\u2019s super fantastic. You come back with a paragraph rather than 10 websites, and that\u2019s great.\n\nBut the trouble is the paragraph might be wrong. So it might, for example, have medical information that\u2019s dangerous. And there might be lawsuits around this kind of thing. So unless we come up with some kinds of social policies and some technical solutions, I think we wind up very fast in a world where we just don\u2019t know what to trust anymore. I think that\u2019s already been a problem for society over the last, let\u2019s say, decade. And I think it\u2019s just going to get worse and worse.\nSummarize this dialogue", "input": ""}
{"category": "text_summarization", "instruction": "Introduction to Psychodynamic Theory in Social Work\nSocial workers balance many clients suffering from a wide range of problems, including trauma, medical conditions, mental health issues, unemployment, lack of education, discrimination, criminal records and more. Pursuing a degree in social work prepares a student to become a practitioner and to help their clients through counseling and social support systems.\n\nSocial workers base their practices on several theories and practice models, including psychodynamic theory. What once was a theory derived from Sigmund Freud is now a network of theories developed and expanded by many theorists since the early 1900s. Psychodynamic theory, also known as psychoanalytic psychotherapy, helps clients understand their emotions and unconscious patterns of behavior. By talking through these emotions and behaviors with a social worker, clients come to know themselves better and make better decisions for themselves.\n\nWhat is Psychodynamic Theory?\nPsychodynamic theory was originally a theory of personality created by FreudExternal link:open\\_in\\_new. It has evolved significantly over the years, and many theorists have contributed to it. Freud believed human behavior could be explained by intrapsychic processes and interpersonal patterns outside of a person\u2019s conscious awareness and based on their childhood experiences. A general definition of psychodynamic theory is that forces outside of a person\u2019s awareness explain why they behave a certain way.\n\nToday psychodynamic theory is not a unified theoryExternal link:open\\_in\\_new. Instead, there are many related theories regarding human development and personality. These different theories have various treatment processes, some of which are used by social workers and other clinicians, like talk therapy, dream analysis, free association and transference.\n\nHow psychodynamic theory differs from other types of therapy\nMany modern types of therapyExternal link:open\\_in\\_new emphasize mitigating or getting rid of the symptoms of a problem. For example, if a person struggles with anxiety, cognitive behavioral therapy helps a person address the symptoms of their anxiety. Psychodynamic theory, however, explores a person\u2019s deeply rooted drives, needs and desires. It\u2019s considered a more global approach to therapy than a modern, problem-based therapy. You also can look at it as a difference between focusing on a person\u2019s emotions versus their behavior.\n\nThe Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual\nModern psychology and psychiatry use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)External link:open\\_in\\_new. The Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM) was published in 2006 as an alternative or additional guide for clinicians to diagnose and treat clients. It was sponsored by:\n\nThe American Psychoanalytic AssociationExternal link:open\\_in\\_new\nThe International Psychoanalytical AssociationExternal link:open\\_in\\_new\nThe Division of Psychoanalysis of the American Psychological AssociationExternal link:open\\_in\\_new\nThe American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry\nThe National Membership Committee on Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social WorkExternal link:open\\_in\\_new\nThe second edition was published in 2016, and also was sponsored by the International Association for Relational Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy.\n\nA Brief History of Psychodynamic Theory\nMany professionals have contributed to psychodynamic theory and its relationship to social work over the years. The theory has evolved significantly, and it is still part of modern social work. The National Association of Social Workers\u2019 Standards for Clinical Social Work in Social Work Practice (PDF, XX)External link:open\\_in\\_new lists it as one of several theories social workers can use as a basis for their practices.\n\nThe evolution of psychodynamic theoryExternal link:open\\_in\\_new can be understood through four schools of thought:\n\n1. Drive theory\nFreud believed a person\u2019s behavior was the result of several drives including the sex (eros), self-preservation and destruction/aggression (death) drives. The id is the primitive and instinctual part of the mind that contains the foundation of these drives. It is the instinctive portion of a personality.\n\nAs a child develops, external forces from the world make it difficult to satisfy these drives. Eventually, the superego and ego impose internal hurdles and restraints. The superego is responsible for the morals of society as taught by a person\u2019s parents, operating as a moral conscience. The ego mediates between the id and the external world\u2014it is responsible for decision-making.\n\nWhen a person\u2019s drive-based desires might become conscious, it triggers a conflict between the drives and the superego or the ego. When a person fails to repress their desires, it creates anxiety and activates defense mechanisms.\n\n2. Ego psychology\nTheories on how a person\u2019s ego functions have evolved since Freud. He believed the ego developed from the id alone. But theorists later believed the ego did more than regulate a person\u2019s drives. Some theorists believed the ego developed autonomously\u2014free of intrapsychic conflict. They believed people had another drive to explore and control the world around them. According to ego psychology, a person\u2019s environment and reality were also important to their development.\n\n3. Object relations theory\nPsychodynamic theory originally saw behavior as a function of drives. Later, theorists explained people\u2019s behavior based on object seeking. People were shaped by their relationships with significant others around them, like their parents and siblings. Under this theory, a person\u2019s struggles have to do with their focus on maintaining relationships with others while also differentiating themselves. As adults, people repeat object relationships they formed in childhood.\n\n4. Self psychology\nUnder this theory, a person\u2019s perception of themself is in relation to their boundaries or differences (or lack thereof) from others. Theorists believe narcissism has a healthy place in development and adulthood, though narcissism isn\u2019t to be confused with narcissistic personality disorder. A person with a lack of self-esteem or an undeveloped sense of self might experience mental health issues. A person with a healthy sense of self can self-regulate and soothe and is resilient. Some theorists believe a lack of a sense of self came from a lack of parental empathy during childhood.\n\nAssumptions of Psychodynamic Theory\nThere are several key assumptions in psychodynamic theory:\n\nAll behavior has an underlying cause.\nThe causes of a person\u2019s behavior originate in their unconscious.\nDifferent aspects of a person\u2019s unconscious struggle against each other.\nAn adult\u2019s behavior and feelings, including mental health issues, are rooted in childhood experiences.\nBoth innate, internal processes and the external environment contribute to adult personality.\nGoals of psychodynamic theory\nPsychodynamic therapy pushes for clients to:\n\nAcknowledge their emotions. Over time, clients can start to recognize patterns in their emotions and address them, which can lead to making better choices.\nIdentify patterns. Clients can begin to see patterns in more than just their emotions, but also their behaviors and relationships. Or, if clients are aware of negative patterns in their life, therapy can help them understand why they make certain choices and give them the power to change.\nImprove interpersonal relationships. Modern psychodynamic theory helps clients understand their relationships, as well as patterns they exhibit with relationships.\nRecognize and address avoidance. Everyone has automatic ways of avoiding bad thoughts and feelings. Therapy can help clients recognize when they\u2019re acting in a way to avoid distress and how to move forward addressing their emotions with healthy coping mechanisms.\nStrengths and weaknesses of psychodynamic theory\nThere are several strengths to psychodynamic theory. It recognizes that a person\u2019s childhood impacts their mental health as an adult. This idea is readily accepted in modern psychology and social work.\n\nIt recognizes that an adult is the product of both nature and nurture. People have internal drives that influence their behavior. Childhood experiences affect them, too.\n\nFreud\u2019s psychodynamic theory also led to psychoanalysis, which used talking as a way to identify and treat mental health conditions. Conversation is a fundamental aspect of therapy today. When you think of a clinician asking a client, \u201cHow does that make you feel?\u201d that\u2019s psychodynamic theory and psychoanalysis.\n\nThere are recognized weaknesses of psychodynamic theory. It doesn\u2019t account for a person\u2019s ability to think and control their behavior. Many theorists believe it doesn\u2019t consider free will enough.\n\nIt\u2019s considered unscientific because it\u2019s difficult to prove. The theories are largely unsubstantiated. But modern medical advances have provided supporting evidence for the benefits of psychodynamic therapy.\n\nHow Does Psychodynamic Theory Apply to Social Work?\nSocial workers can benefit from applying the fundamental assumptions of psychodynamic theory to their clients. Every client\u2019s behavior has a reason. It isn\u2019t random or happening in a vacuum. Their behavior also is likely partly or mostly in response to unconscious processes. The client might not realize why they behave a certain way.\n\nObject relations theory and self-psychology moved psychodynamic theory from a one-person issue, focused on the unconscious issues of an individual, to two-person psychology, focused on relationships. This fits well with social work. Social workers often focus on a client\u2019s interpersonal relationships, including the client-worker relationship, to learn about the client\u2019s behavior and promote change.\n\nSocial workers often work with clients with multiple difficulties. Psychodynamic theory in social work provides a conceptual framework for understanding seemingly unrelated symptoms or patterns of behavior. The framework of theories offers social workers a way to address all of the client\u2019s issues.\n\nSocial workers hope to promote change and improvement in a client\u2019s life. By using psychodynamic therapy, they can help clients get to the root of their thoughts, emotions and behaviors. This provides a chance for self-discovery. A client has the opportunity to learn more about themselves, recognize harmful patterns of emotions or in relationships and alter their behavior.\n\nTypes of psychodynamic treatments\nThere are many different treatments social workers can use as part of a psychodynamic approach to modern types of therapyExternal link:open\\_in\\_new. The psychotherapy will focus mostly on talking. Clinicians let the client\u2019s direct the conversation, but other techniques can be complementary to talk therapy including:\n\nTransference: A person redirects their feelings and expectations of one person onto another\u2014usually unconsciously. Transference is common in therapy. The client applies emotions toward their clinician and acts toward them as if they were the other person. Transference can happen in a variety of relationships, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily demonstrate a mental health issue. When a social worker identifies and understands the client\u2019s transference, they can gain a better understanding of a part of the client\u2019s life and their condition.\n\nFree association: A clinician might encourage a client to write down or speak all the thoughts that come to their mind. It might be an incoherent stream of words. It might be a random assortment of memories and emotions. The purpose of free association is to make connections between topics that might go unnoticed. This was originally developed by Freud, though it\u2019s not a common therapy technique today.\n\nDream analysis: Freud also developed the technique of analyzing dreams as a way of learning more about a person\u2019s unconscious. Modern psychodynamic clinicians use dream analysis as part of person-centered therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and Gestalt therapy (in Gestalt therapy, there\u2019s the belief that dreams are messages a person sends themselves.)\n\nCriticism of Psychodynamic Theory\nPsychodynamic theory has been criticized as being too deterministic or victim-blaming to be used in modern psychology and social workExternal link:open\\_in\\_new. The original theories believed people had no control over their own behavior. There was a lack of personal agency.\n\nAnother criticism of psychodynamic theoryExternal link:open\\_in\\_new, as defined by Freud, is that it is sexist. Freud believed women were inferior to men. He also believed men had stronger superegos. Women\u2019s weaker superegos made them more prone to anxiety. It\u2019s important to remember that Freud predominantly treated and studied middle-aged women in Vienna.\n\nIn more recent decades, psychodynamic theory has been criticized as not only sexist but also not a sufficient theory or treatment for people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nPsychodynamic theory originally didn\u2019t account for social issues like sexism, racism, poverty and homophobia. Some practitioners felt psychodynamic theory focused too much on psychotherapy treatment rather than addressing broader social concerns. In other words, practitioners focused on finding the underlying, personal cause of a client\u2019s problems instead of addressing larger social systems that impact the client.\n\nThis is a particular concern for social workers who identify social justice as a core value of their profession. Modern social workers and practitioners consider the broader social structures that affect the client.\n\nTo summarize the key points of this article, please show their deeply nested relationships (parent-child) in indented form", "input": ""}

\"this whole thing about abundance and attracting to yourself what it is that you want and how to use mantras and spirituality to make sure you have what you want true spirituality is about not wanting is about being filled with joy from inside and then sharing that outside it's not about attracting to yourself what you want people ask me is there a law of attraction yes and you better be scared of it because if it's true that you attract what your mind is thinking you better take a look at what your mind is thinking what about your mind all day when it's complaining and it's yelling at people and it doesn't like stuff but if you're attracting that way so you eventually catch on that it is not about getting what you want it is about learning to find out that what you really want is to stay open and not have conditions on that openness and then it comes down to how do you do that are people capable of doing that or is that just reserved for you know some special beings Buddha and Christ that have walked the face of the Earth everybody is capable of that if I tell you to pick up five thousand pounds you may not be able to do that so I've told you to do something that you have never done and you're not doing it so you may not be able to do it but if you're actually already doing something and I tell you not to do it you're always capable of that because you're the one who's doing it need motivations watch a top ten with believe Nation hey it's Evan Carmichael and I make these videos my first business I struggled to believe in myself I quit on my business partner and the thing that saved me was watching the successful stories of entrepreneurs they gave me the inspiration to keep going as well as the strategies of what to do and quite honestly I still need their stories and motivation today as well so today let's learn from one of the best Michael Singer and my take on his top 10 rules of success enjoy inside you are the one who's closing your heart you close it you are the one who's closing your mind you do that they're your thoughts it's your feelings they're nobody else's so you are in there doing these things so if I tell you the way to stay open is to not close I don't teach how to stay open that's more like finding out how to get what you want I'm interested in you learning to not close but a difference if I say to you I want you to open your heart right now you wouldn't even know how to start but if I say to you somebody says and you don't like don't close you know where to start right because it's happening inside of you and you see the tendency to do it all I'm asking you to do is don't do that I'm telling you that will take you the whole way don't worry about opening worry about not closing there are going to be events that unfold in your life that naturally open you a beautiful sunset a bird singing sometimes you get what your mind wants all right you open great nothing wrong with that don't close how come it only last a minute I'm going to see a beautiful sunset you feel like oh my God I looked into the face of God then you go right back into your mind with all your problems why why don't you learn to not close why don't you get some openness start to work with yourself to not close and this is how to get what you really want the teeth the Deep spiritual teachings are really teaching you how to get what you want because what you want is to feel love and joy and happiness all the time and so if you can get that from within you then can share it rule number two is discover your real self the mind is very strong and one of the things the Mind does is develop methodologies or ways of thinking that let it interact with life and not get hurt and be more comfortable and it's the ego when we develop a self-concept and we change it through our lives but in general there's a self-concept sitting under there saying I was the one that did this and I was the one that went to the school and I'm the one that went there and the one that my father left or stayed or whatever the hell it is excuse me and basically uh all of this unfolds and you end up developing patterns of thinking based upon the experiences you've had all right and what I'm saying at least certainly in my experience is that's not what makes you wake up that's what keeps you from waking up all right the fact that you're identifying with these past experiences and saying that's who I am well it's not who you are you are watching your ego you see it get upset you see it fix things you see it have Concepts and Views and Etc et cetera and even you're obviously very intelligent you can use your intellect to support the ego to support that and and so on right and I'm sure yes you're a very special person very intelligent person and therefore that becomes part of your self-concept okay and then you say a religious person part of your self-concept all of these things are ways you think of yourself and there's nothing at all wrong with that it's wonderful you've been successful you're happy you're doing well all right I'm not happy I'm not doing well I just said that and also like weeping openly at this moment okay but listen to me right that identification with your personal self which is just your mind's thoughts are what keep you from waking up rule number three team is recognize your needs instead of asking why am I not okay why am I not okay you're asking what do I need to be okay that's the major difference of whether you're growing inwardly or you're attached to struggling externally is you think I can only be okay if I get the things that I got before or similar you extrapolate right things that made me had a relationship and eighth grade and it was so beautiful and she was redheaded okay my wife no that's not true all right he was redheaded and she left you know should her parents move right and it was never a bad experience in that relationship it was just the most perfect relationship you've ever had right you understand now if I'm grown up and I I go on a date and shoot a red hat she redheaded I have a pretense propensity toward being open you just asked a question why do we think we need these things all right because we're not okay inside and we've had experiences either you read a book it'll tell you you need that to be okay you watch a movie meet somebody you can have a thought if I had a Tesla okay it used to be a Ferrari that's a Tesla all right I I man everyone would be proud of me and I feel like I'm helping the ecology and so all of a sudden I'm not okay I'm going to go to Tesla and if I get a Tesla oh my God for a while how am I doing wonderful so that's how you develop your preferences these things all right because we're not okay inside and we've had experiences either you read a book it'll tell you you need that to be okay you watch a movie meet somebody you can have a thought if I had a Tesla okay it used to be a Ferrari that's a Tesla all right I I man and or perhaps a little time without the children and we make our list nobody's judging just be honest you put that down the purpose of this discussion is no matter what you put on that list unless you're very highly evolved my experience is it's not really what you want it's not that it's wrong it's just not really what you want and the way I prove that is as follows let's say you put down I want a relationship I want to meet somebody I want to have that special relationship and then I would ask you what if you would be the most amazing thing but it's Hollow for you you go there and you thought it would turn you on but it doesn't and you just Lowe's going to work and you're just not excited about it so therein lies the what do you really want because what you're going to find is if you were given the opportunity to have a relationship with that person I just described or have the job I just described but it didn't do SWOT for you and it left you hollow inside you would say I don't want it in fact if it's this video absolutely for free there's a link in the description below go click on it and start building the momentum in your life and your business I'll see you there rule number five is overcome anxiety what you want to do is say what's behind the anxiety so when when people talk I don't help people make decisions but we talk about decision making is the first thing that matters is what's your motive now what should you do if how can you figure out what to do if you don't even know your motive right and my you became 23 years old I realized that that voice was running my life and that's what you're saying if it wasn't comfortable I left if it you know whatever it was it was determining what I said it was determined how I acted it was determining everything about my life and yet I didn't know a thing about that voice why was it saying what it was saying why why is it like one person and not another because when you like somebody your voice says I like her so what that come from right and if all of a sudden it said no I don't think so I was in his glory because you know you pull yourself aside it's going to say a lot of stuff made me realize I don't listen to that thing that thing's crazy it just changed his mind all the time it says this it says that like the reason people drink and do drugs is because that thing's driving them crazy do you understand that are you trying to get away from that in inner mess that's going on inside so basically over the course of many years I started an experiment which was what would happen talking about the personal mind I like this I don't like that I believe in this I don't believe in that I want this to happen oh my God I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow because I'll die if it rains that kind of junk just the personal noise that instead of honoring and respecting life is judging it and trying to tell me how to make life be my way instead of my respecting that life took 13. notice amazing thing that energy that was all weird because you didn't touch it it changed it was able to come up all right or you start using affirmation right you sit there and say oh come on this is probably a an older person like my grandmother my grandmother I do yes yes that's right they get to drive and I should not be talking at them or bothering them or even sending them bad vibes maybe they should not be driving any faster well well and the point is it's a latter part of their life and at I trained Mickey this I trained Michael this way all right as I sit there and I look and I say how did it get hot be quiet how did it get hot what do you mean why is it hot well because there's a son out there you mean there's a star 93 billion miles away and you're it's hot it's so hot that you feel it's heat here I'm in Gainesville Florida Miami is about 300 miles away I asked them how big would a fire have to be in Miami for you to steal it in Gainesville if the whole town caught fire you would not even know being grateful and turned on by all of the amazing things that are happening in front of me and all the past experiences I got to have why don't I just enjoy all that and then come into life filled with love filled with joy and give the hold of my being to the moments that are unfolding in front of me that's that's what spirituality says so it's not about renunciation it's not about things are wrong and things are right it's about understanding that you did this you did this with your mind you set something reminds you of them when they were negative experience they tend to close you and that is where you get your list of what you want that's why all of our lists are different everyone's listening is totally different someone tells you this is the same as yours they're manipulating you because everyone has had different experiences and based upon those experiences it left these Impressions on your mind and you came up with this list of what I want so when you make the list of what you want make it through this and even if I don't whatever it is I will be a better person because of this if you're in into God running everything if that's your state God knows what he's doing there are so many different things that you can do with positive thinking to create a nicer environment inside in my opinion you have an obligation to do that both for yourself for the health of your body for people around you you just lift yourself up like he just says one should raise the selfless self not trample down the of course put aside some time in the morning and evening to remind yourself that this is what I'm doing annual number 10 the last one before some very special bonus Clips is work on yourself all you can be responsible for is yourself your starting position is right you have to evolve with the different situations that are presented to you and my experiences if you do that the rest will happen the people around you will be raised naturally understand that like if you bring anger into a situation imagine a household or always did you build this building I said yes he said would you build an addition on my house I swear to God that's exactly what happened all right and because I was surrendering to life nothing inside of me wanted to build clothes in the garage of this Sheriff all right I'm not even a builder I built a couple of buildings on my own land you know rough sawn Timber Etc and I said yes and that founded my first company built with love and I ended up building a custom houses and this and that and then I got into computers and the next pretty well because you made it this far in a video I want to celebrate you most people start and don't finish most people never actually follow through most people say they want something but they don't ever do the work to actually get it but you're different you are special believe Nation you made it here all the way to the end and I love you so as a special celebration if you put a hashtag believe down in the comments Below on this video I will showcase you and celebrate you s\"\nSummarize in bulletpoints", "input": ""}

{"category": "text_summarization", "instruction": "can you please summarize this transcript into 500 words and make bullets of the key points \n\nWelcome, everyone. It's day number eight of our yoga business mastery course. Great to have all of you here today. We will be chatting about time management, and this is a really, really important topic whenever you try to do anything new. But it's particularly important for yoga teachers because yoga teaching takes up a whole bunch of your energy. It's something that people don't talk enough about. But teaching just one class, especially if you're doing something that's new, can drain you for half the day. Teaching two classes, three classes, you can be completely done. So a lot of teachers that I meet, one of the struggles, even when they come up with new ideas, good ideas, growth plans, is trying to figure out how do I take the next step and where do I find the time? And especially for those of you who are juggling other things, whether it's another job or kids or family, other work obligations, it can be really difficult. Obviously, we all struggle with time, but I think because yoga well, I know because yoga teachers, that physical drain that it has on you, sometimes it can be really difficult to find the time. That's what we will be covering today. Let me give you a visual here, and we will jump right in here is going to be our focus for today. It's just to think about time as a default currency. What I mean by that is we often think about money or the US dollar or the yuan or whatever you might be thinking about. But really it's just time, right? We all have a limited number of time in the day, a limited number of years in our career, and a limited number of years on the planet. What are we going to do at that time? How are we going to make the most of it? So every consideration that you make about money is really a consideration for time. You've probably heard people say that you should stop trading dollars for hours. I'm not sure if you've ever heard that before, but the reality is we all do that. We all trade dollars for hours. That's how it works. Now, your hourly rate might be very high or it might be very low, but this is why they call it work. You give your time and you get something in return. And so no matter what we're doing, we want to be efficient and we want to try to figure out how to build something new. As we've talked about a number of times, one of the challenges in the yoga industry is because it's very free form. And what I mean by that is you'll get very little guidance from your peers, from your employers, from studio managers in terms of what steps are next. The only way that those next steps will happen is if you turn off Netflix, isolate, sit yourself down at a desk and start to get to work at putting these pieces together and that can be really challenging. And this isn't unique to you, it isn't unique to yoga. It's just a thing that all of us struggle with. Let's take a look our agenda today. First, we'll chat about feeding the dragon. And this is an analogy that I use which I find very, very helpful. We'll talk about different tools, software tools, and little tricks that can be helpful for your time. This is a really important one. Time vultures. Things that can really suck your time and suck your energy away. Chat about how to have a dopamine purge and how to buy back your time. And then some tips and missteps that might happen along the way. Before we do that, it would be really interesting for me and probably for all of you just down below in the chat, just share what's your biggest challenge with time management right now? And for some of you, it'll be, I have a kid and they're two and three years old. That's real, right? For some of you, your biggest challenge is maybe following a calendar. Maybe you really struggle with that. For some of you, maybe you're working two jobs. For some of you, maybe you struggle to work on your own. When you think about, like, time management, when you think about your week, we're here on Monday. What is the thing that comes up for you in terms of the thing that makes you struggle the most? And it could be anything. Maybe you don't have a good filing system. Maybe you're working from home and your partner is also working from home and you're both kind of still haven't figured out how to make all of that work. Maybe you run out of energy, maybe you get distracted by social media, whatever it might be. Dropping down the chat. I'd love to hear what kinds of things you personally struggle with. And we'll learn from each other as we go. Okay, feed the dragon. This is an analogy. Your dragon is your business. And the reason I use the analogy of a dragon is because dragons are huge and they're always hungry and they always need to be fed. Why? Well, there's so much bigger than us, right? We get hungry a few times a day. Dragons are always hungry. If you start to think of your business like a dragon, and I like to think about it like these sort of friendly dragons that you ride around the sky and you think about the dragon being you, your knowledge, your skills, your experience, and then your community, the people who know, like and trust you, that's your dragon. The dragon needs to be fed every day, all the time. And when you internalize that, it helps you to embrace the journey from yoga teacher to yoga business person, whatever that means for you. And so when you make this transition, the idea is, this is important, this is my job, this is my purpose. And if I don't feed the dragon, what will happen is the dragon will fly away. It'll go somewhere else. And so the reason this is important to keep in mind is because on a daily basis, there's a lot of stuff that needs to have happen. It's really, really common that you start to get frustrated and overwhelmed and discouraged, and you feel like, this isn't what I signed up for. But when you start to come back to, what are the bricks and mortar of a yoga business? It's me, my skills, my knowledge, my experience. It's my community. The people who know, like and trust me. So if I'm doing work on those two things, one, two of them, both of them, all of them, I'm feeding a dragon. If I'm feeding the dragon, my dragon will stay happy. It'll fly me around, and I can live my life. If I don't feed the dragon, it will fly away. What does that mean in real life? In real life, it means for you, it means studying something every day. It means doing a yoga practice every day. It means learning and growing. It means gaining more experience. It means constantly investing in your new asset deliberately and in a very crafted way on a regular basis, always reading something new, always learning something new. Maybe you're in a course, maybe reading a book. Maybe you're watching YouTube videos. Maybe you're practicing a new studio. Maybe you're learning something from another modality that you can pull into your classes, but always feeding you that asset. And in your community, this is the one where a lot of people slack off, and they haven't answered my emails in ten days. It's a bad idea. Or, I never answer my direct messages. People just ask me stupid questions. That's a really bad idea. Remember your community. That's an asset. You that's an asset. Really, really important to focus on that. We had a really good teacher here in the studio, but she misunderstood some of these concepts about a yoga business. And we had a student who wrote a really negative review on Google, places like Google Maps or whatever, and the student said, I went to the door of the studio to ask a question, and the teacher hid behind the desk. I was like, there's no way that happened. There's no way the teacher would hide behind the desk. And then someone on my team says, we better check, because they know it's a public review. It's a one star review on Google. It looks terrible, so we better check. So we have these security cameras, and we check, and sure enough, the student comes, knocks on the door, and the teacher hides behind the desk, and she has her phone, and she's hanging out behind the desk on her phone. And listen, we've all done things like that before. We've all done things like that before. And probably what she was thinking is, she's going to be another person asking me what power yoga means. She's going to be another person asking me what time classes. It's all on the website. These students drive me crazy. And is there a truth to that? Yeah, of course there's truth to that. But I'm sharing this story with you because it's kind of extreme. But I'm sharing this story with you because it's a very common trap to fall into where you go. It's all pointless. I'm just going to ignore it. But remember, if it falls into those two buckets, you and your community, that's the dragon, and that's a hungry dragon. You feed the dragon. Keep feeding the dragon, your business will continue to grow. You'll continue to create positive momentum. You'll continue to attract students to you. The moment you stop feeding the dragon, either you or your community, things start to get stale. They start to get stagnant. They dry up. The majority of the teachers who I grew up practicing with as a yoga student, they're no longer feeding their dragon. They don't really communicate with me or other students. They don't really do a lot of new learning or growth themselves. And their classes, which I see through occasional photos that they might publish on social media, are getting smaller and smaller and smaller. This is a shame. This is a waste. These are excellent teachers, but they're not feeding their dragon. Now, the teachers, on the other hand, who understand this concept of you, your community, it's a dragon. Part of my time management means when somebody knocks, I get up and I answer the same question again and again until they don't have questions. I'll keep answering it, right? Until I've learned everything. I'm going to keep studying. I'm going to keep buying books. I'm going to keep watching YouTube videos. I'm going to keep educating myself. And where will I get the motivation? It's the exact same thing. My knee hurts. Okay, I don't know that much about knees. You see this positive feedback loop. You learn what you need to learn based on the questions from your community, and the whole thing really becomes a positive snowball. It sounds really simple, and I know that a lot of you are saying, I would never hide behind the desk and plan my phone and ignore a customer. You might. I don't think any of us are above it. But the only way you would do that is if you lose perspective. This teacher who I'm speaking up, she's actually a really good teacher. She has a ton of potential, but she's missing this element. She doesn't understand this element. And if you don't get this, it can really take you sideways. This is part of my job, answering the knock on the door, which often these days shows up as a text message, a DM, a comment underneath the photo, all of these things. It's part of your job. Just an hour ago, I sat down in the middle of the floor back there in some awkward stretch, and I answered about 45 messages. Were some of them redundant? Sure. Were some of them boring? Yeah, kind of. But you know what? That's my job, right? It's my job to feed the dragon. And that particular dragon was community. Some of these students were new. Some of them were students I haven't spoken to in a couple of years. But they have questions, and what they're saying to me is, hey, you're a teacher, and I value your opinion. Can you help me out? What kind of teacher would I be if I ignored that message? What kind of teacher would I be if I ignored and just rolled my eyes and said, oh, why don't they just go read the articles on my website? I'll tell you, what kind of teacher would I be? A really boring teacher and not a very good teacher and a soon to be irrelevant feature. So you've got to feed the drag. And when you embrace this, it stops becoming such a constant decision making process, and you just understand knocking the door. Message a comment, a question. This is my business. This is what I'm building. What kind of tools can you use for your time? It's really important you have some kind of calendar system, and I think probably all of you do have some kind of calendar system. What might that be? It doesn't really matter, but maybe it's GCal, like Google Calendar. Maybe you use ical, maybe whatever calendar you use. But make sure you have a calendar system, and you need to live by your calendar. The more you teach, the more your calendar will really be crucial. Inevitably, we end up with really irregular schedules. As yoga teachers, even when we do our best to stabilize, there's still a random discovery call here a random private class, there a random workshop at the end of the month, and the vast majority of yoga teachers I know don't really have themselves organized. I don't care which calendar system you use, but I really encourage you to use something digital and make sure it works. Cross device. So if you're using GCal or ical or whatever it is, make sure you're using it on your phone and your computer, and make sure you live from there. Other things that can make your life really easy not really easy, but easier are alarms. So especially if you start to get your regular schedules, which many of you will like. Maybe you have a 10:30 a.m. Morning class on Mondays and Wednesdays, and then on Tuesdays and Thursdays you teach in the evening at 07:00 p.m. At a CrossFit box or something like this. When you wake up in the morning, you open up your Google Calendar, you open up your ical, whatever you're using, and you go in and you set timers. So if you need to leave the house an hour before your class starts, you set a timer, just like an alarm. If you have a phone call set up with a prospective employer or a prospective student and it's at 530 in the afternoon, you set a timer for 525. So you have five minutes to set up and make sure that you have your headphones in or whatever you need to do. A calendar and a timer can make a really big difference. Every yoga teacher I know who starts teaching quite a lot, their calendar becomes both absolute essential and also a source of anxiety because they're checking it constantly. Am I missing a class? Am I missing a class? What's here, what's there? Making sure time zones are synced up. So go digital, make a choice and just commit to it. Even if your calendar is pretty open right now, start to schedule in simple things like your practice, maybe some reading time, maybe some studying time, just so you start to get in the habit of it. I know some of you already have this habit for many, many years, but make sure you start to apply it to your yoga life as well. Another thing that's really important is to start using some templates. You will get a lot of questions that are the same and what templates mean is in Gmail, and I know most of you use Gmail, but it's also in other email servers. If you would like, there are templates that you can use in Gmail. They're called canned responses. I'll drop it here, I'll drop it here in the chat. It's called canned responses. And I'll send you a link, a HowTo video, how to set it up later on. But the reason canned responses are so helpful is because sometimes you're feeding your dragon and I'm going to be honest, you're going to get bored. And what do I mean by that? You go, oh no, somebody else is asking for the zoom link for the Tuesday class at 06:00 P.m. And you're typing hey there, blah blah blah. You go, It's fun. The first few times, yes, they're signing up. And then the 13th time you go, I don't want to do this. You put it off until the next day and the client's upset and they're worried this is a scam and they're freaking out. What can responses do? And in instagram they also exist. I think they're called instant replies. I'll send you a video on how to do that one too, is it allows you to answer similar questions the same way. And so what I mean by that is I have a bunch of these set up and so one of them is just my default zoom link. So I do a lot of just ad hoc zoom meetings with students and with colleagues and with other studios and things like this. And so I just have a little quick shortcut and it sends my zoom link right away because I probably send this three or four times a day and it's really annoying to go in and copy and paste and go through that whole routine. Now I know a lot of you are going out of some of you all do it, but really, even after you get like seven or eight emails of people asking, hey, how does this work? Or where do we go for the meeting point? Let's imagine you're doing outdoor class and you're doing like a yoga hike hike plus a yoga class, sunset and there's a meeting point, right? That sounds really simple, except you're going to need to send a Google Maps link where to meet. You're going to need to send time. You'll probably need to send your cell phone, your mobile phone number, these kinds of things. And so using Gmail canned responses, using instant replies in Instagram, you can very quickly and then you feed the dragon quickly and it's fine. If it feels laborious to answer emails, you'll stop doing it and that will be a mistake. There are other questions that you'll get a lot of. Maybe you have a class on, maybe you have some very unique classes, right? Maybe you're specialized in autoimmune conditions and you work with fibromyalgia and you get a lot of people who say, I don't know, maybe they have a specific type of pain question and it's always the same, well, you can write a really great email, put it in your canned responses, and then you're ready anytime anybody needs that. Maybe you create a thank you email that you sent to all your clients after class. Remember the other day we said with new students it can be great to send an email, we use a canned response. And how a canned response works is, let's say I have seven students in class today, two of them are new. After class canned response, I go into Gmail and I just pull down from a drop up down and says, great to have you in class. And I add in the person's name. So I say, Dear sir, great to have you in class today. I just wanted to let you know if you have any questions, I'm here hope to see you in class again soon. And if you have to type that out manually, you'll do this for like one or two classes, you'll never do it again. But when you have it in canned responses, you'll do it again and again and again. You'll be really consistent. These little things make feeding the dragon less of a hassle. It becomes just part of your work. And yes, a little bit of busy work, but there's a tremendous amount of busy work that you've learned to do in your life, from starting the dishwasher to taking out the garbage. And there's a whole bunch of things you don't really think about it anymore. And when you can create easier and easier ways for yourself to feed the dragon, you won't think about it. You just buzz to get things done. Okay, I will send you tutorials how to set up canned response because I'm guessing most of you don't have it set up in Gmail. And also tutorial how to set up instant replies in Instagram so you can do that later. This is another big one is meal and snack planning. People don't talk about this, but yoga teachers especially when you teach more than if you teach more than one class a day, the food thing is really a problem because you don't really like to eat right before class. And then after class, maybe you don't have a big enough break. Or it's a funny time, like four in the afternoon. And so planning your meals can really make your life a lot easier. And maybe that means you spend a Saturday afternoon or a Sunday afternoon doing some food prep. Maybe that means you figure it out in advance, but it really makes a big deal. And the way that you eat affects the way that you feel. And if you're hungry and you're having a great day but then you get starving and your blood sugar drops at 05:00 p.m., that's not going to work out very well. And so specifically for this type of job, obviously it's healthy food is important for everybody. But for this type of job where you get stuck in these blocks where you don't really have access to food and then you don't really feel like eating, meal planning is a big deal. We'll talk a little bit more about this later on. You really need to toggle between busy work and deep work. And what I mean by that is you need to get yourself in a routine of answering emails, answering messages, doing phone calls if you need to, sending messages and then doing deeper work. What we're doing now is deeper work. Thinking, strategizing, planning outreach to new studios, creating new opportunities, planning and preparing for new class formats, developing new workshops and things like that. You can't do deep work all of the time. In fact, most of us do mostly busy work. If you think about what you've done today, for example, most of us, even if we've had a really productive day, mostly we did a whole bunch of silliness, right? We cleaned the house and then we ran out and then we forgot the keys and then we did this and then we did that. Maybe we did about 30 minutes of work here. And if you get in two or 3 hours of real work in a day, that's actually pretty significant. I think this is the biggest discovery from the pandemic, from work, from home. People realize like, I wasn't actually doing that much work. It's kind of running around. And so when you're putting yourself, when you're creating a workflow for yourself, it's important to just embrace that there are different phases of the day and set aside time to do busy work. Set aside time to do deep work. And don't attempt to plan an entire workshop in one fell swoop in 6 hours straight. Schedule less and do more. And this is something that is absolutely a truism. If you have less things planned, you'll get more done than if you just kind of pack yourself in. And this especially has to do with classes. If you have a ton of classes on one day, like three classes, you're really going to have trouble getting much done. And so try to keep your scheduled events simple and blocks of time free so that you can plan to feed the dragon ongoing in a sensible way. And you do that by scheduling less and doing more. I'd like to chat a little bit about this. We chat about this on day number one. But part of time management is getting rid of time vultures. And the way that I like to think about this is if somebody from your past will not be part of your real life in the future, you have to respectfully unfollow them and let them live where they belong, which is in your memories. I'll share with you a story that really affected me. It's a very silly story, but it really, really affected me. A few years ago, I had someone get in touch with me on Facebook and she sent me a message and said, hey, Luke, we used to walk to school together in Minneapolis when we were five years old. So nice to find you here on Facebook. And I had this kind of existential crisis. I had 5000 friends on Facebook at the time. This person, I didn't recognize the name. Technically, I was born in Minneapolis, but I know Bangkok better than I know Minneapolis. I don't know anything about it. I certainly don't know this person. I'm looking at 5000 friends. I'm looking at this message and I'm thinking about stuff that I don't even remember. And I realize this has gone too far. This has gone too far. And technology is amazing, communication is amazing. But this person was part of my five year old experience walking to school. This is not relevant. This is not where I should be putting my time. I should be investing in the people in my current and my future life. I should be investing time in my current and my future job and projects. And the way that I phrase this is like the lost art of forgetting. Someday I'll do a lot more writing about this, but like in the old days, you just forget. You just forget people. And I don't mean that with any kind of malice or anything like that, but you would just forget people and you would forget things. And maybe you'd be at a class reunion and somebody said, hey, do you remember Jason from the soccer team, from the football team? He'd go, oh yeah, Jason, where is he now? And that'd be great, right? But you don't see Jason on your newsfeed every single day. And the birth of the kids and the marriage and the divorce and the trip to the Maldives, and this is too much. Jason is not part of your life anymore. And yet most of us are just overwhelmed with people from our past, whether they're positive, whether they're negative, whether they emotionally trigger us or not. But they're not part of our future. And I think for most of you, if you started to look at what you're paying attention to, there's a lot of ghosts from your past. And ghosts isn't even the right word. And in many cases, they're really positive memories and positive people. And yet if I said, hey, are you going to call them this month? That would be weird. Why is that weird? I don't know. It's been so long. Where do we start? And they live in another state. They live in another country. They're doing this thing well. Are you angry at them? No, of course I'm not angry. We have such great memories. So, I mean, are you planning like a re? No, I don't think we're ever going to see each other again. Okay. Unfollow block. Poof. They're gone. That includes cousins. That includes uncles and aunts. I don't mean this with any kind of malice, but if you don't plan to visit that second cousin or that first cousin who's doing weird stuff on Instagram, you got to get rid of them. You got to get rid of them because remember what we chatted about, your time is your greatest asset. If you're giving time to people who you openly and freely admit you have no plans to make plans with, that doesn't make any sense, right? It just doesn't make any sense. You're better off just knocking on your neighbors door and saying like, hey, how's it going? You're better off hanging out on Instagram and talking to your real life today students than you are somebody from your past. The hard thing is it feels like it's almost invalidating. It feels like those friendships or those experiences or that previous job colleague who you have so many great laughs with, who you now haven't seen in twelve years. It totally matters and it's totally irrelevant. And you got to let it go. It's a lost starter, forgetting. And when you do that, suddenly you'll have more space in your day to do things that are relevant to you right now. Time Vultures the biggest one, of course, is social media. For exactly the reason that I said for many of you right now, when you log into social media, you can see these people from your past, both ghosts and also very positive people from your past, who realistically will play zero role in your future. Were you to have a major life event, you would not notify them. Were you to do anything significant, they would not be part of that experience. They've got. To go. The other one that's really difficult, especially right now, is news. And it's really a delicate balance because we want to be informed, responsible citizens. We also want to help out and participate as an active member of society to some extent, some of you more than others. But it's really difficult when, like, right now, we're in the midst of just a very, very difficult news cycle, and news is coming at us, not just from creators of the news who are problematic in their own right, but it's coming at us from social media people. It's coming at us from high school students who are suddenly broadcasting battle scene updates and things. It's completely overwhelming. And again, while all of us want to be informed and educated and participate in democracy, I think as much as we can. And again, some of you very much so. Some of you not at all. We don't want to be kicked around for things that we have no control over. In the same way I have no control or influence over Jason's life, my high school buddy who's now living in a different country and married and struggling with the construction business. I also don't have control over things outside of my sphere of influence. I'm not saying put blinders on and ignore the world, but I'm saying you got to have some sort of filter, or you can get sucked down every single news cycle. And while I know it seems really intense right now, it's very unlikely this will ever stop. I don't mean this situation that we're in right now. I mean this amplification of the news, which has progressively happened over the past five years. After this crisis passes, let's hope soon there will be more, and they won't stop. And so you have to set some tools in place, or you can suddenly become a war correspondent when really you're meant to be a yoga teacher. And your yoga teaching work in your own little place, in your own community can have a really tremendous value. Whereas being kind of an amateur work correspondent, which many people are right now, is not adding value or helping. It's just proliferating anxiety. It's a really tough one. And again, I don't have the answer. And I know just even talking about that, I don't know what to do. How much do I learn? How much do I not learn? But the news is a rough draft of history. Giving yourself some space in the news cycle is helpful. Here's another really big one, is phone notifications. I was at lunch with a fellow yoga teacher recently, and we both had our phones on the table, as you do during lunch, and her phone just started going bonkers. I mean, just bonkers. And I was like, what's going on there? Is everything okay? Like, is there an emergency? It's like, no, it's just instagram. And I just saw her phone. I guess this is what people have every single notification, every single comment, every single heart of her morning photo of yoga or whatever was pinging her phone. You got to turn all that stuff off. That stuff will just make you crazy. Just make you absolutely crazy. And I know for some of you, you're like, yeah, I did that a long time ago, but I would say, really? Did you flip up your phone right now and take a look? You have notifications. Just turn them all off. Turn them all off. See what you can get away with. You might even be able to turn off notifications from friends and family, and you might be able to change a setting so that if they call you, that phone comes through. So, like, my kids and my partner and stuff, if they call, my phone makes a special sound, and they almost never call. And the reason that I do that is not because I'm some sort of maniacal control freak or anything like that, but because, again, I had that moment where I'm sitting at lunch and my phone was quieter but still not physically buzzing, but still was lighting up. Her phone was on fire, just on fire. And I thought, what does any of that have to do with your happiness, your mission, your clients, your business, your contentment? Zero. Nothing. It's just completely a time stock. But if you start to look at people's phones, including your own, you'll mostly see notifications happening like crazy. If you turn all of that stuff off, it can be a really great relief. And that's when people do different things. Like, they'll go they'll turn off. They'll go on airplane mode and turn everything off. If those things work for you, that's fine. I find that for most people, that's not really realistic, because maybe you end up researching things, maybe you end up emailing from your phone or whatever it is. But if you simply turn off those notifications, that can make a big difference. And then think about these in terms of time vultures, the other thing that I think is important to think about is zero value add people and zero value add events. And this sounds really ruthless, but at the same time, it's just honest. And what I mean by that is there are some people in your life who don't add any value to your life. That doesn't mean they're bad. That doesn't mean that they're stupid. That doesn't mean that you should be mean to them, but it means that they're not actively contributing to your growth. They're not actively sharing positive ideas. They're not people you turn to when you have a conflict. They're just there at different times of our life. We have a lot of zero value add people. When my middle son was younger, actually, when my first kid was the youngest, my daughter, she was the youngest, somehow I didn't really understand how to navigate parenting, and I'd end up at all you have these play dates, right, where the kids play, and suddenly I'm hanging out with tons and tons and tons of parents. And by hanging out, I mean just hanging out, talking about random stuff. These are really, really nice people who I don't have anything in common with. Really, really nice people who I don't have a past, a present, or a future with. Really, really nice people who are suddenly having barbecues and meet ups and gatherings, which really just are not for me. They're wonderful people, and we don't really get along. They're really great people who I do not turn to in a crisis. They're really great people who I do not share inspiring ideas with. And a lot of you have zero value add people, and in no way do I block these people from my life. In no way am I mean or cruel. But at the same time, you got to think about the people that got you to where you are. Probably not the same. We're going to take you to where you're going. And who are those people? Right now, little by little, can I opt out of those events, can I opt out of those social situations to create more space? Because, again, if we think about building a business, we're actually thinking about building time. When we think about building time, we're talking about creating more space to be able to do more creativity. So think about those zero value add people and zero value add events. Almost all of you have some of them, and for some of you, it also includes stuff with either relatives or in laws. And those can be really tricky. And again, in no way am I advocating, like, ruthlessly cutting people off, but just kind of carving off healthy boundaries and thinking about not sure that this is really serving me anymore. Not sure that I'm really excited about this anymore. Let me stop. And also some things that you can find very fulfilling will suddenly one day just become zero value add, meaning I am no longer growing. I am no longer learning. Let me switch. Let me pivot with all smiles and nothing but good feelings. Let me make a move. Dopamine purge. And this is something so we have these neurotransmitters. I'm sure you've heard of them. Different happy chemicals. There's four main happy chemicals, and dopamine is one of them. And dopamine is released very much in anticipation of and so they talk about dopamine a lot with, like, drug addiction. But the dopamine, the dopaminergic pathway is actually triggered more from the craving than from the actual drug use itself. And so this like, could I get a notification I just posted on Instagram? Did five people like it? Did ten people like it? Especially that randomized. It really triggers your dopaminergic pathways, which is why social media is so addicting. The randomness, the unpredictability. Anything could happen. What could possibly be on TikTok today that's what really, really triggers us. And so this isn't good or bad, but it's a thing. And right now there are more dopamine hits than ever before in human history. So much so that my 17 year old daughter, if left to her own devices, will literally plant herself on the couch and just swipe on TikTok, right? Take the phone and kick her out of the house. It's a thing. It's a problem. It's just as big a problem as somebody been to drinking or been smoking is a thing. And all of us get into this. So what can you do? Here are some of my suggestions is you need to really get in the habit of unsubscribing, unfollowing blocking people who are causing this weird feeling, this weird feeling. And so turning off notifications for sure does this. Actively unfollowing and blocking and unsubscribing from people are really important. For some reason, LinkedIn has turned into total garbage recently. I don't know why. It used to be really boring stuff like, here's what's happening in the health market. People in the industry would post like, some charts and things like this. It was really, really dull. Suddenly it's just become all the normal mimi stuff that you find all over the Internet. And I have been active, unfollowing people at the rate of like ten to 15 per day. And I do it with a smile on my face and nothing but love. But I just don't want to see this stuff. I want to stay focused on the things that matter to me, the things that matter to my clients, the things that are growth oriented, and a meme that says no pain, no gain. You can choose whatever you want in life and this kind of stuff, I don't need that anymore. So actively, actively blocking these things. We chat about Time Vultures and a lot of these are friends from our past, but the demons from your past are worse. And that's that boss who you hated but you still have a connection to on LinkedIn. And every time they post something, you secretly curse their name. That's your ex who you quietly stalk on Instagram late at night when you said you wouldn't. And now you are. Just block them. Once you block them, you will forget them. Blocking is such a wonderful feature and not enough people use it. Your block list should be like a mile long and growing every day. Every time you see some celebrity who you don't like coming on your newsfeed, just block them and poof. They will literally disappear. They will literally disappear. It's great on your phone. I'd really encourage you to take your social media apps and swipe them all the way to the last screen and then put them in a folder. It just makes it a little bit harder to get there. Obviously you can just do an app search and you'll very quickly learn how to do that, but somehow that little bit of extra friction can make a big difference. Some of you will even have more aggressive things where maybe you delete certain apps from your phone and you only use it on your computer. I don't have one right way to do this but if you're not curating your life you will just get sucked into this dopaminergic triggering thing that is your phone every step of the way you just won't get anything done. Never stop curating your inbounds and your inputs. So if you found that hey, you just got on TikTok for the first time and you thought it was all silly dancing and then suddenly like my daughter 8 hours later you're there. Think about appropriate use think about appropriate use what that means for you. Do you set a timer? Do you drag the app? Do you log out of the app? Do you change your password and have somebody else change your password so you can't get in? This is real. It's really a thing. It's a huge crazy problem and it's very difficult to get something done when there's just this quick hit of likes and engagement and ghosts from your past and all these things that can take your attention all over the place. I'm not a puritan. I don't believe that the past is the future. The future is social, the future is online, the future is connectivity but just like anything there's appropriate use, right? When I was a kid in the 80s I'd talk on the telephone to my friends, a wired telephone for like 3 hours my parents had to sit me down and say hey, that's too long, let's limit it to 15 minutes. It's appropriate use, it's appropriate use. It's the same with the television. It's the same with video games. It's just getting harder and harder to control appropriate use. But it's a conversation you need to be having with yourself all the time. If you intend to get anything done, if you intend to get anything done, you have to have these conversations because you just get sucked in. Not by any moral failing, not by any weakness, but because these things are designed to pull you in. This is a conversation that people don't have enough but this is about how to buy back your time and there are a number of different things you can do to quite literally get your time back and it's really really important. I lived in Southern California for quite a while. And I remember I was in Orange County, and there was I guess it was around, like, Mission Viejo. I can't remember if it was Mission Viejo or Laguna Negal, but every year there would be a big Christmas lights thing. Crazy lights, like like just multi millions dollar crazy homes. White lights. Spectacular, like just way over the top. And so I remember driving around this neighborhood this would have been like, I don't know, early 90s or something. Driving around this neighborhood to see the lights, right? See the lights on these crazy mansions. And I remember seeing these people washing their cars, and I remember looking at it, and I just think because I always had to wash the car. When I was a kid, my dad made me wash the car. I've watched the car like a million times, every part of the car. And I remember sitting there and I was like, this guy, this woman. They have this house which is worth, I don't know, 3 million, 5 million. That was back then. It's probably worth more now. It's all covered in lights. Here he is on a Friday night, and he's washing his car. I washed the car. He's washing the car. This guy is successful, what's he doing? And this is a trap that we follow into, where we forget. We forget that what we're looking for here is time. Because time is where you can do whatever you want. Maybe you want to learn more. Maybe you want to have children. Maybe you want to write a book. Maybe you want to go on vacation, sit on the beach. But the mistake that people make is that more is more is more. More notifications, more tasks, more and more. At some point, you have to stop and say, I need to get my time back. I need to buy my time back. So a couple of things. One thing that has been revealed during the pandemic is a lot of this work life balance research has kind of come to the forefront. And one of the top deciding factors about whether people like their job or not, in some studies, it's as high as number one is the fact that your work is less than ten minutes from your home. Work is less than ten minutes from your home. And so this is why a lot of people, despite the stress and the mental health and the rules and the scariness of all the COVID stuff, a lot of people are happier working from home. Is it that they really like to be huddled over a laptop? Is it that they really like to be working in their sweatpants? I don't know. Maybe some people. I think a lot of people miss getting dressed up and going to work, but, you know, they don't miss a 45 minutes commute. They don't miss sitting in traffic. This is something that we don't like. And so if you can figure out a way to do micro living, this can totally transform your life. Meaning if you can think about that statistic, if my work can be ten minutes or less from my home, that might be more important to me than how much I'm making. That might be more important to me than even what I'm doing. How can I arrange that? So what might that mean for some of you? It might mean moving out of the city, getting a less expensive home with a garage and teaching from there. For some of you, it might mean moving into the city so you can walk everywhere. For some of you, it might mean just thinking about not taking the job from the studio. That's all the way across town. I had a friend who started teaching a lot of private yoga, and she initially had her clients within. Her whole thing was like a ten minute or less taxi ride. She was living in Hong Kong, and that was her whole thing. And then little by little, she started taking out more clients. More clients, more clients. And then she's in a taxi for 45 minutes. She's in a taxi for an hour. And she just had to stop and stop taking the clients. And for her, she understood that less money was not less. It was not less. Less money was not less. Right? You have to optimize. At some point, you have to buy back your time. And sometimes buying back your time means earning less money, but having more space. Because if spending 45 minutes on the road to get to a studio is not worth it, you got to make that a priority. I used to work with this guy, a really successful, famous yoga teacher, and he lived and lives in Los Angeles. And Los Angeles is as many of you know, it is a city, technically, but it's kind of like this whole basin, right? And so he started working at this studio, and they were really excited about him, so they offered him a percent ownership of the studio. They just threw it at him. Hey, we'd love to have you teach here. Here's the deal. If you'll come teach here just once a week for the rest of your life, basically we'll give you a 10% ownership in the studio. Well, of course, the studio wasn't making any money. And of course, once a week, who cares? That's the greatest deal ever. He likes teaching, but the studio is an hour and a half in Los Angeles traffic, an hour and a half drive, right? And so I just want to give you an extreme example, because he ended up giving up 10% ownership in the studio because he didn't want to take the class. And it was the right decision. It was the right decision, right? You got to buy back your time. It's just not worth it. There are other things that a lot of people don't think about for buying back your time, which are very smart things to do, ordering your groceries online. I think almost everybody has been doing this since the pandemic, but it can make a massive difference. Your grocery list is remembered. You can get the same stuff. It makes your life a lot easier. Now, I know some of you like to go to the market. I also like to go grocery shopping, but I also like to have free time. You find the balance. Maybe you go every other week. Maybe you go every couple of days instead of every day, but trying to figure out how can I get back some time so I have more space for me. My practice, my studies, my learning, my growth. So I have more time to answer those emails and those questions coming in for my students and not feel like my whole personal life is falling apart. Food prep is a big one. Here's my routine. Which just sounds completely when I tell people that, wow, this is crazy. So on Sundays, my ten year old and I, and sometimes a three year old comes along to we go to the market and the market is, I don't know, about 20 steps from my house and we have a little wheelie cart. I call it the grandpa cart. And we go and we fill it up with, I don't know, pretty much I just buy every fruit and vegetable in the shop and then we take it home and have somebody who comes to help me. And it costs around \u20ac10 per hour. She loves to come and people need work and they're looking for work. I used to wash cars. I've done all these jobs. I used to mop floors, they used to clean bathrooms, they used to pour beer. People need jobs, right? People need jobs. So she comes on Sunday and what does she do? She washes and cleans everything. And within 3 hours, my entire refrigerator is filled with chopped vegetables and fruit for the entire week. And all of us eat better. We don't order out. We don't get any takeout food. We don't want it. It's really easy. It takes about three minutes to make a meal. Whether it's a salad or a stir fry or whatever, you might make it's all there. This kind of thing takes a little bit of planning, but this is about how you buy back your time. Now, the excuse that I always get from people is like, oh, that's so expensive. I'm like, it's definitely not expensive. Every single person I know eats out more than me. Every single person I know spends more money on food than me. Not because they're lazy, but just simply because they haven't thought about this as an option. You can buy back your time with things like food prep and laundry and it sounds totally crazy, but really it's not. Really, it's not. You need to think about if you're building, if you're growing, if you're tired, you can do this. And there are people all over the world who are really excited to have entry level jobs, thousands of them, at any given time, no matter where you are in the world. Things like laundry, things like house cleaning, really, these kind of entry level jobs, depending on where you are, it might be $10 an hour, it might be $15 an hour. Whatever it is, if you've got your work or your community work, maybe you even start with just a couple of hours a week. But this makes sense. What makes no sense is to have a $5 million house covered in Christmas lights, spending your time cleaning your car. It doesn't make sense. It just doesn't make sense. You should get a smaller house, have somebody wash your car and use that time to do whatever it is you do. Maybe he was a lawyer, maybe he's a golfer. I don't know what he's doing. But there has to be some type of benefit. And where this has to be going is not more right. Your life five years from now cannot be filled from morning to night with busy work and chores and all these kinds of things. At some point, what you're building has to free up more space for you. Instead of buying swag back, buy back your time. I don't own a car. I don't own any I ride an old rusty bike. But certain things you start to realize, wow, there's tremendous value in having this space. There's tremendous value in feeding my family well without stressing about cooking and cleaning these kinds of things. It's really these small little things which can make a massive difference. What does this really boil down to in terms of time? I don't know. If you save yourself 3 hours a week, you think it's not that big a deal. But little by little by little, 3 hours a week, it really stacks, right? That's 12 hours a month. That's almost a part time job. 12 hours a month of free time. If you just took half that, maybe you spend half that time just relaxing or reading a book or doing self care meditating, I don't know, whatever. You go into a yoga class. But maybe you spend half that time, 6 hours a month planning your next workshop, spending time crafting some type of event or training or retreat that will take you. If you spend 6 hours a month on that, that's a tremendous, tremendous windfall of time and energy. So I just want you to think that the goal here is even though so much of this is you're a one person show, you're a one man, one woman show, all that is true. At the same time, I want you to think about building a business also means creating opportunities for other people. And sometimes people forget about that. At any given time, there's a whole bunch of people who need entry level jobs and they'd be very happy to help you. And it's much easier to hire somebody to do simple service based stuff in your house than it is to hire somebody who costs a fortune to do something like marketing or accounting. And oftentimes you can neglect or even put those off for a very long time. But getting some basic, basic health can really transform your work life very quickly. In terms of time management, here's the thing that I just like to think about it. Why are you not coming to this barbecue? Why are you not showing up to this event? Why are you not chopping your own vegetables? And when it comes to your time, you don't have to explain. I'm not doing it because my time is mine. And every single year I'm getting older. Every single year, I get less of it. Every single year, I see more and more value in it. And I want to use my time. I don't need to explain. It's mine. It's my time. So I'm going to do whatever I want with it. Just like it's your money, you can do whatever you want with it. If you like to spend your money on organic food, do it. If you like to spend your money on fancy watches, do it. It's also your time. You get to decide. You don't have to explain. And you can't just make time. Unlike money, which you can make more of, you can't make more time. And so things like, hey, I can't make it. I won't be able to join you. I'll be cheering for you, but I can't go. Thanks for inviting me, but I can't. These are some of my default social event bailouts. And again, with no bad intentions, just let people know you've got to do something else. I'll share with you some real examples because I'm a student of this too. I'm always learning and trying to get better, and I'm as guilty of getting sucked down these dopamine tunnels as anybody else. For my podcast, I interview a lot of authors, and writing a book is very, very hard. It takes a lot of time. And I'm always amazed by how often I get a response of no from authors and their excuse is just great. And they'll often say, Lucas, I'd love to come on your show. I can't do anything until July. I'm writing a book. Get back with me then. I just I always respect that answer so much because what they're saying is, I need to do deep work. I want to do PR, I can't do PR and I got to work. And for whatever reason, I have seen these lines drawn in the sand best by authors. I think it's because it's just so hard to sit down and write 60,000 words. So I've really tried to learn from their example of just with all the best cordial response in the world, just saying, hey, I can't come. I'm working on this. I got something else going on. Love to be there. Support you from afar. Send me some photos. But make time for yourself because nobody else can do it for you. Nobody else can create this time for you. You really have to set it aside for yourself. Okay, so some tips. Phone, computer notifications, turn them off. You're definitely not making noise and definitely not at night. No inbound calls. And when I tell people this, they think this. Is completely crazy too, but I don't answer my phone. If my kids call me, I answer the phone. But even I discourage them from calling me also. They send me messages and then I'll call them back. And I do that because I'm in classes a lot like this. But once you set up this situation, it becomes really conducive to work. It also becomes conducive to better conversations. So when I do call my kids, I am present. When I do call my parents or my brothers, I'm present. And I can be there. I'm not in the middle of the day rushing between places, and I know some people sort of like that spontaneity of communication. But sometimes to create deeper experiences, whether it's a telephone call or a deeper work, you just have to block inbound calls. Surprisingly, you can get away with this. I take almost no inbound calls whatsoever, and I make almost no calls too, which is surprisingly. You can get away with your desk in your workspace free of clutter. In many ways, we're so affected by our environment, and this is a constant, constant battle. I clean my desk two times a day, in the morning and at night, and I aim to have absolutely nothing on it. Right now I have some of these goofy anatomical parts, but usually I have absolutely at the end of the day, I have absolutely nothing. And every day I force myself to get rid of it. Right now, I have no drawers, because if you have drawers, they get filled with papers. They get filled with junk. Just getting rid of things. Getting rid of things. Keeping your workspace clear so your mind can be clear, that has to do with your computer desktop as well. A lot of people, you look at their computer desktop and you go, it's like one of these crazy closets where you open up and the hats and shoes are falling out. It makes a difference. It makes a difference. It's low grade stress, anxiety, and you just feel like there's stuff everywhere. Take some time to dump stuff. If you don't know what to do with it, throw it all in a box and hide the box. If you don't know what to do with the stuff on your computer, throw it all in a folder, drag it to an external drive, upload it to Google Drive, and just forget about it for a while. If you don't use it for a year, forget about it forever. Really makes a big, big difference. This last one is a really big one. And I know some of you are guilty of this. You got to do real work on a computer or a laptop, not on your phone. See, a lot, a lot of yoga teachers trying to run their whole world from your phone. You will never be productive. You will never like communicating. You will never get anything done. If you're just working on your phone. You can do a lot on your phone, but you can't do work. Work. You can't effectively email five studios in a day using your phone. You can't effectively respond to people on your phone. You really need a laptop, you need a keyboard, you need a larger screen. It's really, really important. Meet a lot of teachers who are trying to run their whole business from their phone or from an iPad. Don't do it. Don't do it. It also helps you to kind of segment your time. So work time is on a computer, and maybe your phone is for fun time or relaxing or these kinds of things. But if you're answering more than a couple of emails or a couple of messages on your phone every day, you just won't be efficient. And if you're not efficient, you're not making use of your time. If you're not making use of your time, what are we doing here anyway, right? So you really have to be strict about this for yourself. Some common missteps it's funny because some of the missteps are the common ways that we free up time as well, too. But one of the most common things is that yoga teachers, because a lot of them are running their business from their phone, because a lot of them have not cleaned up their notifications. Meaning, when they get an email, it bings. When they get a heart on their Instagram post, it dings. When Google News sends an update, it dings. And there's a new podcast, it dings. So they don't answer their emails. I've worked with yoga teachers who answer emails about every five weeks. This is a disaster. What happens is you just don't get paid. You don't get jobs, you get overlooked, you get missed. Nobody wants to work with you. It's really important, especially for business emails, like with studios and potential jobs and people inquiring about events, it's really important that you answer messages. It's one of the very simplest ways to stand out. I'll never forget it was one of the early courses that I was doing is probably about, I don't know, twelve years ago in Thailand. We had a group in Thailand for a month for a training course. And we were going around and we were saying, hey, why did you choose this course? Why were you here? And people would say, like, I just always wanted to come to Thailand, or I've been watching your YouTube videos and I remember one student stand up and they said, Lucas, I have to be honest, the reason I came of this training is because I emailed you. And about 2 hours later you emailed me back. And he said, that day I emailed about five different teacher training programs and none of them ever emailed me back. And you emailed me 2 hours. And I'm sitting there thinking like, I put together this course, it's a month long, I got the food, I got the blue. I got all this and the only reason you came is because I answered your email. And then I just had to swallow humble pie and I realized was like, okay, if that's what I've got, that's what I've got. And so, of course, I've done so many other things that I want to be appreciated for. At the end of the day, what this guy is saying is, hey Lucas, your course is okay. But what I really like is you answer the emails. And I realize this is another way. Another way that you can stand out from the industry is just be professional, be responsive and answer people, because almost nobody's doing it very, very common that you'll email people and you will never, ever hear from them ever again. Poor follow up is another problem when working with a lot of yoga teachers, they'll send messages from their phone. It even says sent from iPhone. They don't even bother to turn that off. And they'll be all in lower case or all in caps, no punctuation, this kind of stuff. Unprofessional communication really just a bad idea. Just a bad idea. This is another misstep that can happen, is listening to feedback from non customers. And what I mean by that is if somebody we've mentioned this a couple of times. When people pay, they pay attention. You as a provider should also only pay attention to people who give you feedback. What I mean by that is the majority of the negative feedback trolling critique, name calling that comes my way is from people who've never done business with me. They're just some random person who saw me wearing a mask on Facebook and suddenly think I'm a member of the who knows what party or something like this. And literally this kind of thing happens. And then the other way too, they call you crazy names and all kinds of crazy stuff. And so it's really important that if you get feedback, you pay attention to who that feedback is coming from. It's coming if it's coming from a colleague, pay attention. If it's coming from one of your students who comes to every class, pay attention. If it's coming from a new student who just took class for 15 minutes and then walked out and they said, hey, the temperature or wasn't right, keep in mind that you got to focus on the things that matter. Another problem with time management is just failure to fire clients that are a time vulture. This is really important and it goes hand in hand with stepping over dollars for dimes. A lot of times teachers will work too hard for things that are just not important enough and they won't spend time on the things that are important. Firing problematic clients is a really important part of this industry that you have to get comfortable with. We have to get a client who will just be terrible. I'll give you an example. We had a trainee. This is very recently, about three months ago, and she didn't pass her exam. When people don't pass the exams, we always support them. We give them multiple opportunities. We send them specific feedback, saying, here's what you need to do, and we're here for you, and can we try again in a week? And this kind of thing. And occasionally people get really triggered by it, and they've never I don't know the story. People have different experiences. Any case, this woman went crazy, called me names, told me she was a medical doctor, told me I was stupid, just a stupid yoga teacher. I mean, blah, blah, crazy, crazy. So I tried a couple of times. I'm so sorry. We want to get you through. Let's try again. I do need to let you know you can't talk to me or my staff like that, but it's okay. It happened once. Let's not do it again. Then she sends back, you're an idiot. I bank $1,000. Okay, refunded her and sent her away. That's it. She continues to send messages. We just block her. You have to be willing to do that, because you will get crazy people in the studios. It also happens where you get people who are not well. We've had many times people who come to every class, like, three classes a day. We had one woman came to five classes a day. You have to say, like, here's your money back. I'm so sorry. You got to go. And with all the love and all the compassion, you'll get crazies, and they will completely drain you. I'm a member of different yoga groups and things, social network groups, like on LinkedIn and stuff. And it's one of the more common things. As people are posting about Vulture clients, they're like, what do I do? This person shows up 30 minutes before class. They stay an hour after class. Everyone's uncomfortable. They're asking weird questions. They never go away. They take three classes a day. You have to be willing to just say, like, with all the good intentions, it has been great to have in class. I'm so sorry. We have to part ways. It's really important. You can have one student who can suck up the energy that you could potentially share with ten, and it's just not working. And it's a very real thing in this industry that you need to be comfortable with. Okay, homework, tools. Review your toolkit. What are you using? What are you using for calendar? What are you using for timers? What's going to happen tomorrow morning when you wake up? Do you have a system? If not, don't get crazy about it. Just start making little steps, little steps forward. Auto messages. Set them up. I'll send you in telegram. I will send you how to set up hand responses in Gmail and instant replies in Instagram. They really make a big difference. It just takes a few minutes to set them up. Think about time vultures, whether that's a problematic client, whether that's some celebrity who drives you crazy and they keep showing up on your feed, unfollow block. They're gone. Think about notifications on your phone. If your phone is buzzing tonight, if your phone's age, you get little notifications from whatever app. Turn them off. Turn them off. You'll forget one day later, you'll forget there were even notifications of thing. Your phone will just sit there, dark on the table, uninteresting. Think about buying back your time. What ways could you do that? What ways could you free up your time? Do you have a friend or a relative or somebody you know? Could you post a simple ad to get somebody to help you a little bit? Maybe it's not today. Maybe you're not ready for that now, but in a few months, somebody to free up a little bit of your time so you have more time to invest in the assets that you're building. Your job is not to be doing everything, everything forever. Part of building a business is building opportunities. So your next step in terms of doing that is freeing up your time by getting some of the stuff done around your home that perhaps you're not doing now. Okay, great to have you guys here. Here's what happens now. I will do a quick reset here, and I'll see you back in just a minute for the Q and A. If you have questions, use the Q and A form, but I will open up for live questions as well. I'll see you in just a minute.", "input": ""}
{"category": "text_summarization", "instruction": "Here is a case study for an project we created. Please could you summarise it into 3 sentences that will go in a pitch deck. Each sentence should be about 16 words long...\n\nTHIS HOLIDAY SEASON DISCOVER THE CHARMINGLY CHAOTIC WORLD OF PHANTOM'S FESTIVE FIENDS. THE WEBSITE USES THE LATEST IN AI IMAGING TECHNIQUES AND CUTTING EDGE WEBGL TO CREATE A FUN AND ADDICTIVE EXPERIENCE. SHAKE TO DISCOVER NEW FIENDS AND SHARE YOUR FAVOURITES!\n\nFestiveFiends.com is a visually arresting and addictive experience that showcases the technologies we have been exploring throughout 2022. The premise is simple: Shake a Christmas themed snow globe and a random festive \u201cfiend\u201d appears. Over 10,000 fiends are bedded in a beautiful realtime 3D environment, complete with snow particles, lighting effect and custom shaders, encouraging the user to share their favourites and keep shaking.\n\nThe main technologies used include Bolt, a custom 3D library developed in-house and a unique Phantom \u201cdude\u201d trained model in Stable Diffusion used to generate the thousands of creatures contained in the experience.\n\n00:14\n00:40\nFIEND GENERATION\nEarly on we had set an ambitious target of including 10,000 unique creatures in the experience and it was obvious that AI image generation was the route to take to complete this task. Our recent experiments with Stable Diffusion meant we knew we could control things like the look, position and colour of the output with some precision.\n\nTo keep the look of the creatures consistent across the experience we trained a model on the Phantom \u201cdude\u201d to inject his DNA into the output from our text prompts.This training was done using Dreambooth, an approach pioneered by our colleagues at Google that allows you to `fine-train` an original model with new concepts.\n\nTo read more about Dreambooth and Textual Inversion check HERE\n\n \nASSET PREPARATION\nUsing this model we went through many rounds of prompt refinement to get a look and feel we were happy with. On the final generation we used img2txt to encourage the output towards the desired layout and colour palette, which really helped bed the fiend into the beautiful Christmas landscape our talented 3D artists had created.\n\nOnce we had generated our pool of creature images from Stable Diffusion we had to extract them to place in the final 3D scene. To do this we wrote a custom pipeline explained below.\n\nWe used Carvekit to automatically isolate the creature and create an alpha channel to bed the creature into the scene. Even though we had some control of the output from IMG2IMG, creatures still appeared at different sizes and positions, so we wrote an additional post-processing step to help standardize and make all the creatures uniform. A custom python script using the OpenCV framework handled this, automatically deleting any creatures that weren\u2019t whole or too small and resizing creatures that were too big. Once this step was complete, the script then placed the fiend in the correct position, and saved out a .png with the correct sequential filename. From this final image we then created a depth map using MiDaS.\n\n00:14\n00:24\nGenerate with Stable Diffusion\nRemove background with Carvekit\nCalculate height and translate island\nCreate depth map with MiDaS\nUse the depth map to offset the geometry on the plane.\nWEBGL\nAt Phantom we have been developing sites with WebGL for a number of years and we felt it was time to dive in and start creating our own custom library. The idea was to develop a bespoke set of tools that prioritises performance with the most minimal amount of code to accomplish the task (30kb gzip core). \n\nFestive Fiends\nFRAMEBUFFER GPGPU SIMULATIONS\nIn order to build simulations that can be run on the GPU we developed a tiny custom module called \u201cfbo-sim\u201d. It provides functionality that swaps framebuffers at each frame update so we can read data from the previous frame and build accumulative effects.\n\nThe background aurora visual uses this module to create the fluid-like effect. Two textures are generated, one for the fluid and one for the mouse velocity. On each frame update the mouse position and velocity is passed to fluid pass to drive the motion.\n\n00:15\n00:17\nThe \u201cfbo-sim\u201d module is not just limited to texture based simulations and the same approach can be used to update particle positions in 3D space. Each particle's position is stored in a 2D floating point texture as RGB colour values: Red = X position, G = Y Position and B = Z position. Using the same swapping mechanism means positions from the last frame can be read in order to update the position for the next frame. When the globe is shaken the snow will flurry by applying a combination of curl noise and a vortex flow field to each particle\u2019s velocity vector. Lastly we have a global time value that can be scaled to add the \u201cbullet time\u201d slow motion effect for the zoom transition.\n\n00:14\n00:16\nCUSTOM SHADERS\nAll of the object materials in the experience are written in custom shaders for that extra degree of control over the art style. Being a low level library, Bolt does not store predefined materials so it is up to the developer to create these from scratch.\n\nThe snow globe glass effect was created by rendering the objects inside the globe to an offscreen texture first that is then sampled using screen UV coordinates in the globe glass shader. This texture sample is then distorted using the globe geometry\u2019s normals for the refraction effect, giving the illusions of thicker glass. \n\n00:14\n00:45\nPOST PROCESSING STACK\nAnother important part of the WebGL visuals is the post processing stack that can be toggled on and off when required. Our tiny \u201cpost\u201d module allows multipass shader effects that can be combined or separated per requirements. For this project we only required a single custom blur pass that is used for the zoom effect. A fast Gaussian blur shader is applied to the screen with a masked focus area to create the illusions of depth of field, but a lot faster!\n\n00:01\n00:06\nTHE SNOWGLOBE\nThe snowglobe was modelled and materials added in Blender by the team's 3D artists. Two texture maps were then baked from the materials and lighting, one including the wooden base and the other including the snow and trees. Finally, the model was exported with the baked textures as a GLB and passed to the project 3D developer to implement in the experience with the addition of refraction on the glass.\n\nWith this project, as with all WebGL builds, the team has a series of control panels for crafting and tuning materials, animations, lighting etc. This allows the wider non-technical team to have input into the final configuration to ensure true collaboration between the development and creative teams.\n\nFestive Fiends\nWe built the images above by layering multiple transparent images, to ground our fiend in their environment and add our custom branding to each image. We also created a separate asset perfect for Instagram like social media stories, so our fiends always look their best wherever they are spotted.\n\nFestive Fiends\nNEXT.JS WITH GCP CLOUD STORAGE\n\nFestive Fiends uses the recently released Next JS 13 to generate our website server side, ensuring a fast and responsive experience for all our users. All our fiends have their main image and depth maps stored in a Google Cloud storage bucket, where they\u2019re publically accessible via their respective URL.\n\nWe knew that sharing discovered fiends would be a core part of the experience, and so needed unique and well designed social share assets for each fiend. This would be difficult to traditionally author, as we\u2019ve generated thousands of fiends, and so we reached for Vercel\u2019s OG Image Generation support for dynamically generate assets on the fly.", "input": ""}

{"category": "text_summarization", "instruction": "Please summarize the following:\n\nThere was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. He was an upright man of integrity; he feared God and shunned what was bad. Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. His livestock amounted to 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 1,000 cattle, and 500 donkeys, along with a very large number of servants, so that he became the greatest of all the people of the East.\nEach of his sons would hold a banquet at his house on his own set day. They would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. After a series of banquet days was complete, Job would send for them in order to sanctify them. Then he would get up early in the morning and offer up burnt sacrifices for each of them. For Job said: \u201cMaybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.\u201d That is what Job would always do.\nNow the day came when the sons of the true God\\*f entered to take their station before Jehovah,g and Satanh also entered among them.\nThen Jehovah said to Satan: \u201cWhere have you come from?\u201d Satan answered Jehovah: \u201cFrom roving about on the earth and from walking about in it.\u201d And Jehovah said to Satan: \u201cHave you taken note of\\* my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity, fearing God and shunning what is bad.\u201d At that Satan answered Jehovah: \u201cIs it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have you not put up a protective hedge around himm and his house and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands,n and his livestock has spread out in the land. But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your very face.\u201d Then Jehovah said to Satan: \u201cLook! Everything that he has is in your hand. Only do not lay your hand on the man himself!\u201d So Satan went out from the presence\\* of Jehovah.\nNow on the day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother\u2019s house,p 14 a messenger came to Job and said: \u201cThe cattle were plowing and the donkeys were grazing beside them 15 when the Sa\u00b7be\u02b9ans attacked and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.\u201d\n16 While he was still speaking, another one came and said: \u201cFire from God\\* fell from the heavens and blazed among the sheep and the servants and consumed them! I am the only one who escaped to tell you.\u201d\n17 While he was still speaking, another one came and said: \u201cThe Chal\u00b7de\u02b9ansq formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.\u201d\n18 While he was still speaking, yet another one came and said: \u201cYour sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother\u2019s house. 19 Suddenly a great wind came from the wilderness, and it struck the four corners of the house, so that it fell on the young people and they were killed. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.\u201d\n20 At that Job got up and ripped apart his garment and cut the hair off his head; then he fell to the ground and bowed down 21 and said:\n\u201cNaked I came out of my mother\u2019s womb,\nAnd naked I will return.r\nJehovah has given,s and Jehovah has taken away.\nLet the name of Jehovah continue to be praised.\u201d\n22 In all of this, Job did not sin or accuse God of doing anything wrong.\\*", "input": ""}

While we expected the usual long rains between February and April, these did not come. As a result, many farmers have lost several herds of cattle. The farming community also experienced several losses. The few who managed to salvage their animals or crops had to sell them off in the market at very low prices. A number of human lives were also lost. In a nutshell, we experienced the effects of climate change. These were quite severe. It will take these communities several months to recover. Fortunately, last month the central Government allocated KShs 2.6 billion to cushion farmers from this unpredictable situation. These funds, as reports from my officers indicate, have gone a long way towards assisting the affected population. \nYou are senior counsel in a firm specializing in civil and criminal litigation. Ribah, an opinion leader in in one of the counties hit by the drought, is keen on getting more details on the 2.6 billion allocation, which the Cabinet Secretary captured in her address. In particular, she is would like data on:\n1. Which county(ies) received funding;\n2. How they were selected;\n3. The amount allocated;\n4. Which agencies/programmes were funded; \n5. All the minutes and records relating to items 1, 2, 3 and 4 above; and\n6. Solid evidence of work done on the ground.\n\nRibah instructs you to communicate with the Cabinet Secretary requesting this information. In your preliminary meeting she informs you that she holds a Kenyan and Venezuelan passport. \u201cI need this information in order to exercise my rights under the Kenyan constitution\u201d, she concludes.\na.

Parameters to bet certain amounts would like to any one player winning based on their ability to remember the cards in the deck. Something count counters knew intuitively and why they were banned from casinos a long time ago. \n\nA young researcher on the team had an idea to program one of the player with a new parameter. To lie, or bluff as it is called in poker, he trained on player to bluff 1 single time in the game. After hundreds of thousands of simulations this player was able to win more consistently than those AI players that were playing an optimal game based on the cards. The card counters lost over an over again to a simple premise, \"I know there will be one lie, but I don't know when\". All the players knew the parameters of the other players in order to remove all variables. \n\nTo the surprise of all the researchers, they increased the number of time per game the player could bluff. When increase to 3 or more times their success dropped. Players learned it was not longer optimal to face this liar in a hand. So they folder sooner and trusted the player less. \n\nOverall, it was concerning to the researchers. This AI was winning so much more than it should in a normal distribution of wins. The reason, or only difference, was this controlled variable of bluffing. When applied to politics, policy, business, strategy and problems facing the world, the researchers reported on their experiment by concluding that we should not fear an optimal game of poker, but fear the player that recognizes the other players are limited by their commitment to an optimal outcome. \n\nGenerate a post where the kicker at the end is the reveal that none of this is true.

{"category": "writing_social_media_post", "instruction": "The following is the interview response of the beauty brand CEO, Ardman. Please create Instagram content that highlights your achievements based on the information below. Please separate the article into three parts. Suggest suitable titles, emoticons, and hashtags.\n1) Brand name meaning\nAdman is French. It means see you tomorrow. It means to look forward to new changes with excitement, looking forward to tomorrow as well as today.\n\n2) Start-up opportunity\nCEO Kim Yong-hyeok (born in 1990) graduated from the Department of Venture Management at Seoul National University. Since he was in college, he has been interested in entrepreneurship. While working for a company (working at SK Planet in service planning and strategic planning), he thought that it would be impossible to start a business unless it was now, so he quit writing for the company. He first started with a brand business and is now preparing for several businesses.\n\n3) Growth history\nIn January 2023, skincare brand \u2018A\u2019demang\u2019 joined hands with beauty creator \u2018Arang\u2019, which has 350,000 subscribers, to conduct \u2018live broadcasting (Labang)\u2019 on YouTube. In particular, the 'Arang X Adman Encore 2nd Market' package products, which can only be met during this collaboration period, are organized and introduced, and the purchase certification, review posting events, etc. are held to attract viewers' response, while the chat window in Labang displays purchase certification. and product-related inquiries continued uninterrupted.\nIn fact, 20,000 viewers flocked to this Labang in one day, and from 7 pm on the day of the broadcast to the next day (29 hours in total), sales exceeded 150 million won, so it was a box office success. This is an achievement achieved in just three weeks after building a D2C (Direct to Consumer) shopping mall.\n\n4) Product/Brand Introduction\nArdman's first product is a toner pad. It was born with the meaning of creating a skin that is expected every day. People need care not only for their skin type but also for their skin condition. Therefore, it was produced with the intention of conditioning the skin that is suitable for oneself by considering the condition of the skin.\n\n5) Product/Brand Differentiation\nThe difference between toner pads is that they are large, soft in texture, and contain a lot of essence. The larger size was made in response to the opinions of consumers who use toner pads instead of packs. Normally, 2-3 toner pads are used to use as a pack, but one Aardman product is sufficient.\n\nToner pad and ampoule products have been vegan certified. Both products use Houttuynia cordata ingredients to have soothing and moisturizing effects, and received a green rating from the EWG, an American non-profit environmental research organization, which certifies that they have the lowest harmful ingredients, and were recognized as free from harmful ingredients by the beauty platform Hwahae.\n\nAlso, Ardman's cosmetics use a lot of good raw materials even if the cost is high. For example, purified water was not used in the ampoule.\n\n6) Sales (Marketing) Strategy\nCollaborate with multiple creators to launch products. The first collaboration was with Arang Creator. In addition, we plan to collaborate with several mega influencers. The reason I work with creators is because they are experts. For example, Arang is the best expert in cosmetics. Arang clearly pointed out what kind of needs there are when developing products and what elements need to be developed to meet those needs.\n\n11) Reasons for choosing Cafe24\nAfter doing online business centered on open markets such as Smart Store and Coupang, they built D2C (own mall) 2-3 weeks ago. The strength of jasamol becomes a real customer when consumers buy. When selling on other platforms, consumers stop buying products, but in D2C, it is possible to provide customized benefits or services according to the customer's inclination. Therefore, it is expected that sales can be increased through D2C.\n \n \n \n \uc9c0\uae08 \ubc88\uc5ed\ud558\uae30", "input": ""}

During the seder, families read from a special book called the haggadah, which tells the story of the Jewish people's journey out of Egypt.\n\nThe seder plate is an important part of the meal, and it includes different items that symbolize different parts of the Passover story. Some of these items include matzah, which is a type of flatbread that represents the bread the Jewish people ate when they were leaving Egypt. There is also a roasted bone, which represents the Passover sacrifice, and bitter herbs, which remind us of the hard times the Jewish people went through in Egypt.\n\nAnother important part of the seder plate is the mixture of apples, nuts, and wine. This mixture represents the mortar that the Jewish people used to make bricks when they were slaves in Egypt.\n\nDuring the seder, families also eat boiled potatoes, which represent the hard work of the Jewish people in Egypt. They also eat lettuce, which represents the springtime and new beginnings.\n\nOne fun tradition during the seder is the hiding of the afikoman, which is a piece of matzah. The children at the seder look for the afikoman, and the person who finds it gets a prize.\n\nThe seder also includes singing traditional songs and asking the four questions, which are questions about the Passover story. Guests are often invited to the seder to join in the celebration.\n\nAt the end of the meal, a cup of wine is set aside for Elijah, who is believed to visit every Jewish home during Passover. Overall, Passover is an important and special time for Jewish families to come together, celebrate their traditions, and remember their history.", "input": ""}

{"category": "planning", "instruction": "Create a business plan for the folllowing idea: Entelehia is a virtual reality platform that aims to revolutionise the way theatrical performances are experienced and consumed by providing a new and innovative solution to the challenges facing traditional theatrical performances. \n\nThe traditional theatrical industry is facing a number of challenges that limit the opportunities for performers and producers to showcase and sell their work. Physical theaters and live performances are expensive to access, and the cost of production, cast, and crew can be prohibitively expensive for many performers and producers. In addition, the traditional theatrical industry is often dominated by a small number of well-established performers and producers, leaving little room for new and emerging talent to break through. This creates a number of challenges for performers and producers, including limited access to new audiences, high costs for showcasing and selling their work, and limited opportunities for growth and success. These challenges have the potential to limit the diversity and vitality of the theatrical industry, and to create barriers to entry for new and emerging performers and producers.\n\nEntelehia is a solution to these challenges. Our virtual reality platform provides a new avenue for performers and producers to showcase and sell their work directly to users. By democratizing the theatrical industry and providing a new platform for performers and producers to reach new audiences, we believe that Entelehia has the potential to revolutionize the way that theatrical performances are experienced and consumed. The platform offers a range of benefits for performers and producers, including:\n\nIncreased visibility and access to new audiences: By showcasing and selling their work directly to users on our platform, performers and producers will be able to reach new audiences and build their brand in a digital environment. This is especially important for new and emerging performers and producers who might not have the resources to showcase their work in physical theaters or live performances.\n\nReduced costs and barriers to entry: Traditional physical theaters and live performances can be expensive to access and participate in, and the cost of production, cast, and crew can be prohibitively expensive for many performers and producers. By providing a virtual platform for showcasing and selling their work, Entelehia reduces these costs and barriers to entry for performers and producers. This allows more performers and producers to participate in the theatrical industry and showcase their work, leading to a more diverse and vibrant theatrical industry.\n\nEnhanced user experience: Our platform is designed to be immersive and interactive, allowing users to explore and experience theatrical performances in a new way. This enhanced user experience is likely to drive increased engagement and interest in the performances on our platform. This is especially important in today's digital age where attention spans are shorter and people are looking for new and engaging ways to experience theatrical performances.\n\nBy offering these benefits to performers and producers and providing a new and innovative solution to the challenges facing the theatrical industry, we believe that Entelehia has the potential to become the go-to destination for virtual reality theatrical experiences and to drive growth and success for performers and producers in the digital age.\n\nConsumers also face challenges when it comes to experiencing theatrical performances. Many people live in areas that lack access to live performances, or cannot afford to travel to see performances. Others may have mobility or accessibility issues that make it difficult for them to attend live performances. Additionally, consumers are often limited to the performances that are available in their local area, which can lead to a lack of diversity and limited options for experiencing new and exciting performances. \n\nEntelehia addresses these challenges by providing a virtual reality platform for experiencing theatrical performances. Our platform offers a range of benefits for consumers, including:\n\nIncreased access to new performances: By providing a virtual platform for experiencing theatrical performances, Entelehia makes it possible for consumers to experience performances from all over the world, regardless of their location or accessibility. This allows consumers to discover new and emerging performers and producers, and to experience a wider variety of performances than they might otherwise have access to.\n\nReduced costs and barriers to entry: Traditional live performances can be expensive, and many people are unable to attend due to the cost of tickets, travel, and accommodation. Entelehia's virtual reality platform eliminates these costs and barriers, making it possible for consumers to experience a wider variety of performances at a lower cost.\n\nEnhanced user experience: Our platform is designed to be immersive and interactive, allowing users to explore and experience theatrical performances in a new way. The enhanced user experience is likely to drive increased engagement and interest in the performances on our platform.\n\nBy offering these benefits to consumers and providing a new and innovative solution to the challenges facing the theatrical industry, we believe that Entelehia has the potential to become the go-to destination for virtual reality theatrical experiences. Our platform allows consumers to experience performances from all over the world, regardless of location or accessibility, and to discover new and emerging performers and producers. Additionally, the platform eliminates the costs and barriers associated with traditional live performances, making it possible for consumers to experience a wider variety of performances at a lower cost.\n\nFurthermore, our platform is designed to be accessible and intuitive for consumers, with a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate and find the performances they are interested in. We will be constantly updating our content to offer a wide range of immersive experiences, and we believe that our platform is the perfect solution for the challenges facing the theatrical industry, and that it has the potential to revolutionise the way that theatrical performances are experienced and consumed.\nIn conclusion, Entelehia is a virtual reality platform that offers a new and innovative solution to the challenges facing the traditional theatrical industry. Our platform offers a range of benefits for consumers, including increased access to new performances, reduced costs and barriers to entry, and an enhanced user experience. We believe that our platform has the potential to become the go-to destination for virtual reality theatrical experiences, and that it will drive growth and success for performers and producers in the digital age.\n\nThe virtual reality market is experiencing significant growth, with the global VR market expected to reach $45.09 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 26.3% during the forecast period. This growth is being driven by increasing adoption of VR technology in a range of industries, including entertainment, gaming, and education. The theatrical industry is also a significant and growing industry, with the global theatrical market expected to reach $50 billion by 2024.", "input": ""}

I got more serious about moving and searched more broadly but was discouraged I couldn\u2019t find any video post produciton work that had any meaning to me. I basically gave up. Then one day I randomly decided to give it another shot and almost immeditely stumbled on a twitter tweet from a studio called dash in nearby Raliegh, who not only seemed like the first company I\u2019d even consider, but on top of that they were announcing \u201cDash Bash\u201d, an upcoming weekend \u201cfestival of motion design and animation, featuring talks from some of my favorite artists/animators. It seemed too good to be true. And that feeling only increased, as the \u201cBash\u201d itself was so powerful and inspiring, breahting new life into my more and more jaded feedling about my career possibilities.\n\nTHis is obviously wayyy too much info to include in a cover letter.

Listening to the teachers read the jumbled-up letters on the page, I was fascinated by how they could easily bring the pictures to life. The first day that I truly became literate, it was like another world opening up. My fingers couldn\u2019t find books fast enough. My relationship with words has been a powerful, fantastical and even sometimes disastrous journey.\n\nI would like to say that I\u2019ve always known the power of words, but that simply isn\u2019t true. The power that a word can hold jumped at me like a thief in the night the first time I encountered my own personal bully. They took the words that I\u2019d proudly written and made them less meaningful than trash. However, it was that bully that forced my reading and vocabulary to grow. They made me realize the power that a few sentences could hold in an instant. Like swords in battle, they can quickly cut and decimate your opponent. Mastering the tactics of battle, you turn from the opponent to the victor. The need to be the victor drove me to books. And books opened my eyes to a whole new way of thinking.\n\nI have that bully to thank for leading me to the children\u2019s book Harry Potter. The moment I slid open those silken pages, my eyes couldn\u2019t devour them fast enough. The story pushed the limits of my vast imagination and truly allowed me to soar. The moment the journey was over, I missed it. And there hasn\u2019t been another book since that has truly satisfied that high.\n\nWhile I had dabbled in writing my own love stories a time or two, my need to find another fantasy that consumed me like the Harry Potter series pushed me into trying my own hand at writing. The moment my fingers hit the keys, the words just started pouring out of me at a rate that even I couldn\u2019t control. Who knew that the shy, introverted child had so much to say?\n\nWhile my relationship with written words are the things of dreams, my plunge into speaking often has disastrous consequences. Never have I been a good public speaker. In school, it was the day that I dreaded. Despite my preparation, I would trip and stumble to the podium only to repeat my performance in my carefully planned words. While they say practice makes perfect, in my case, practice has made mediocre. But to get the world to hear your words, sometimes you need to find the courage to speak them.\n\nEven if the delivery isn\u2019t perfect.\n\nThough my journey with words started in frustration, it turned to fascination and wonder in a minute. Even with many years of reading under my belt, I\u2019m still humbled by the power that a single word can hold if used the right or even the wrong way. Sharper than knives or softer than a silk, finding the right words is always an interesting journey.\"\"\"\"\n\nMy literacy narrative: \"\"\"", "input": ""}

Then, we charge people say $50-100 for access to the info on people that wanna meet people.

{"category": "writing_advertisement", "instruction": "You are a Story Brand marketing expert, creating Facebook ad copy for the following lead magnet, which should include the Primary Text, Headline, and Description :\n\nTITLE: \n\nSoul Spark Healing & Guidance\nVALUES ASSESSMENT\nJill Jablonski, Certified Spiritual Life Coach\n\nBODY:\nHELLO BEAUTIFUL SOUL!!\nI\u2019M SO HAPPY THAT YOU FOUND YOUR WAY HERE!\n \nHave you ever asked yourself - Why does it seem so easy for some people to get what they want, and to have the life and relationships they desire? And then for others, it seems so difficult, challenging, and even painful? Sometimes it feels like as soon as you start to get ahead, something else happens that demands your attention.\n And there it is, right there\u2026.ATTENTION.\nYour attention is a valuable commodity and people will do almost anything for your attention. Think about how much money is spent in advertising every year. If some- one can control what you are paying attention to, then it\u2019s easier to control you and the direction of your life.\n \nSo what are you paying the most attention to in your life? What are you focused on day in and day out? Are they things and people that matter to YOU personally or are they things/people that you\u2019ve been told \u201cthis is what you need to focus on or pay attention to\u201d?\nEven if you\u2019re not sure what exactly the answers are, determining your values is the first step to making sure your attention and focus is going to the things and the people that are important to you. This is the first step to building a life that feels fulfilling! You\u2019ll feel more joyful and your relationships will be stronger and foundation- ally solid.\nLet\u2019s get started!!\n \n \nSTEP 1\nI would strongly encourage you to set aside at least 30 minutes of undisturbed alone time to complete this exercise. (Make sure the kids and pets are taken care of ahead of time and the Do Not Disturb sign is hung!) Sit somewhere comfortable (but not so comfy you\u2019ll fall asleep!). If you have a meditation or journaling space, that\u2019s perfect.\nPro-tip: Make this a really sacred time for you \u2013 light some candles and incense, play some soft music \u2013 and set the intention to go inward, connecting with your Higher Self. This is really important.\n\nSTEP 2\nThe Lists \u2013 There are 3 lists starting on page 4 of this document: one for Life Values, one for Spiritual Values, and one for Relationship Values. Go through each list and rate each value from 1 \u2013 5 (1 is least important to\nyou and 5 is most important to you). Try to be really discerning with your ratings because at the end of each list, you will be asked to determine your Top 5 from each section (Life, Spiritual, and Relationship). P.S. \u2013 There are blank lines for you to write in anything that\u2019s important to you that\u2019s not already included on the list.\nPro-tip: Go through each of the lists a couple of times if you need to in order to whittle it down to JUST 5 that are MOST important to YOU (not what anyone else thinks you should say). If you really get stuck, try discerning which values you have rated as 5\u2019s that you could give a 4.5, and then count those 4.5\u2019s as 4\u2019s. And of course it\u2019s okay to take a break and come back to the exercise with fresh eyes.\n\nSTEP 3\nYou should now have a Top 5 Values for each Life, Spiritual, and Relationship, totaling 15. Post these three Top 5 lists in a prominent place \u2013 perhaps the inside cover of your journal, on sticky notes on your bathroom mirror, or take a picture of them with your phone and make it your wallpaper \u2013 somewhere easily accessible to you where you will see them all the time.\nSo you know your most important values\u2026.Now what???\n\nHOW TO USE\n\nUse this list to evaluate where in your life you can make better choices about what you are spending your time, attention, and focus on.\nDecide what needs to change ahead of time: for example, maybe you have determined that family time is more important to you than being accessible at all hours of the day to your company. Perhaps you decide, based on your values, to make a rule for yourself \u2013 no work after 7pm. You now stash your phone/laptop at 7pm sharp and designate your evenings for family time. Imagine how much happier you will be and stronger your relationships can be just based on that simple change stemming from making decisions based on your most important values!\n\nOr perhaps you\u2019ve determined that you really value your Sundays for alone time for the fact that it allows you to start the week feeling refreshed and prepared. If you\u2019re truly making decisions based on your values, when someone asks you to do something social on a Sunday, your answer is that you\u2019re not available that day \u2013 no matter how badly\nyou don\u2019t want to \u201churt their feelings\u201d \u2013 you\u2019re not available that day. If it is something you\u2019d like to do, you can offer another day that works for you, but on Sundays, YOU ARE NOT AVAILABLE. PERIOD.\n\nMaking choices and focusing your attention based on your values is one of the most important steps you can take towards a happy, fulfilling, self-directed life \u2013 a life\nwhere you feel like you\u2019re in control of your time and not at the mercy of everyone\nelse. Maintaining firm boundaries around this is one of the most important acts of self- love and the bonus is that you become a model of self-love for all those around you!\n[Values checklists go here for SPIRITUAL VALUES, RELATIONSHIP VALUES, and LIFE VALUES]\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nAs we grow and evolve throughout our lives, it\u2019s perfectly natural that our values will evolve as well. It\u2019s good to periodically pull this exercise out and re-evaluate your values to see if ad- justments to your life need to be made. This especially true if you\u2019re noticing that you\u2019re not as happy as you used to be, something seems off, or life just doesn\u2019t quite feel as satisfying anymore.\nPro-tip: You can really power up your values work by harnessing the Astrological energies. See the section on How to Work With Me for more info!\nFeel free to connect with me in my free Facebook group and on Instagram to let me know how you\u2019re getting on.\nJill, what if I have a hard time implementing this into my life?\nExcellent question \u2013 and you are NOT alone.\n\nDepending on how long you\u2019ve been living out your current patterns and your level of awareness, this can be a really tough thing to do, so please do not beat yourself up about it.\nLook at it this way \u2013 when an athlete wants to build a good, solid foundation for a long, healthy athletic career, they hire a coach to help them see and work on what needs improvement. We all grow faster through team- work and support!\n So if you\u2019ve gotten as far as you can on your own, it may be time to hire a coach!\n\nHOW TO WORK WITH ME\nWhen you work with me in my Unlimited Soul program, you get intensive Astrology, Tarot and Energy support throughout the coaching program.

Then you just have to wait for the new emails to warm up for around 14 days and you\u2019re ready to go. Once you understand the system you can give this tutorial to your VA\u2019s and make your life even easier.\n\nIf you combine this strategy with personalised first lines, you can get even better results. \nBut this strategy works even without personalisation.\n\nBefore starting, create a free Instantly account here. We\u2019re going to be using Instantly for automating email sending.\n\nPS: We got a lot of requests for short video tutorials about these steps, so we created the Instantly Accelerator (8 modules with videos, docs and mind maps that cover every single detail - you get access as a Instantly Growth or Hypergrowth user).\n\nBefore we get into the specifics here are the rough estimates. You can set up this exact system for 1 email account too, but this is to show you the potential and scalability.\n\nNumbers:\n\n1000 emails daily\n30K monthly (50% open rate)\n15K opens (5% reply rate)\n750 replies (15% positive)\n112 booked meetings (75% show-up rate)\n84 live demos (20% close rate)\n16 closes ($1K ticket)\n16K/mo\n\nCost / Tech Stack:\n\n10 Domains - $90\n3 Google Workspace accounts & emails - $18\n30 Extra Google Emails - $180\n30K Leads from Apollo or Leadhype - $99\n30K Leads Cleaning with BulkEmailChecker - $30\n30K Leads Sending with Instantly $97\n\nTotal: $514 the first month, then $424/mo\n\nInvestment Gain - $15,486.00\nROI - 3,112.84%\nNot too shabby right?

And for each domain we want to create max 2-3 email accounts. From each email we\u2019re going to be sending only 30-50 emails a day to not get stuck in spam.\nBuying Domains (10 mins)\n\nBuy domains that are similar to your main domain. Top-level domains work best. We\u2019ve had success with domains like .agency .tech too, but if possible, buy .com domains.\n\nIf your business is called Shrimp.com, then buy domains like:\n\nGetshrimp.com\nTryshrimp.com\nTastyShrimpApp.com\n\nHere\u2019s a list of domains with the worst reputation. Don\u2019t use these.\n\nWe use GoDaddy for buying Domains, because we\u2019ve used it for a long time and it has tons of integrations and tutorials. You do you.\n\nTIP: Make sure you go to https://account.godaddy.com/subscriptions and cancel all renewals if you do not want to use these domains for more than a year.\n\n\nSetting Up Google Workspace (3 mins)\nGo to https://workspace.google.com/ and click Get Started. Follow the on-screen instructions until your Google Workspace account is set up. You can safely create 2-3 emails per domain (by adding users in your Google Workspace admin). \n\nCreate a new Workspace account for each of the domains you bought.\n\nSetting Up Domains - SPF, DKIM, DMARC & Forwarding (15-20 mins)\n\nNow we get to the fun part! You should authenticate all the domains you are sending emails from. Here are the three parameters you have to set up for each domain: SPF, DKIM and DMARC.\n\n1) Set up SPF\n\nAssuming you are using Google Workspace you can follow this guide to set up SPF.\n\nYou can check if your SPF is properly set up using this tool.\n\n2) Set up DKIM\n\nAgain, assuming you are using Google Workspace you can follow this guide to set up DKIM.\n\nYou can check if your DKIM is properly set up using this tool.\n\n3) Set up DMARC\n\n\u200b\u200bImportant: Configure DKIM and SPF before configuring DMARC. DKIM and SPF should be authenticating messages for at least 48 hours before turning on DMARC.\n\nAssuming you are using Google Workspace you can follow this guide to set up DMARC.\n\nYou can check if your DMARC is properly set up using this tool.\n\n4) Set up Forwarding\n\nAlso, you want to forward the new domains to your main domain. This can be done in the settings of your domain provider. If you are using GoDaddy, you can follow this guide.\n\nSetting Up Emails Accounts (10 mins)\nIn order to later warm up your emails on Instantly, you need to make a few changes in the settings of your Google Workspace account and separate emails.\n\nYou can do this by following this guide.\n\nYou can monitor, tag and reply to all replies inside of the Instantly centralized master inbox/unibox. \n\n\nWarming Up Emails (15 mins)\n\nIn Instantly click the flame icon for all your email accounts you added to enable warm-up\n\nWe recommend using the suggested sending limits.\n\nWarm Up your emails for at least 3 weeks before starting your campaigns. As you can see in the image below we have 30+ domains warming up at any given time for our agency. That will allow you to really scale it up and get to that 5+ demos/day mark sooner. \n\nAlways keep the warm up on - never turn it off.\n\nMaking sure everything is set up correctly\n\nBefore starting your campaigns, you want to make sure the domain and email set up is done correctly.\nFor domains, use SPF & DKIM check.\nFor testing email spamminess, use Mail Tester.\n\nIf something's wrong, go back and quickly fix it :)\n\nLeads & Targeting\n\nFinding leads is easy, the harder part is knowing exactly which kinds of leads are the best. We approach it based on case studies. Who are the people who have gotten the most value out of your or your clients service? And who in that company is in charge of dealing with your offering.\nIf you don\u2019t exactly know who to target just try different options until you find a targeting & email combo that works. Then just get as many similar leads as possible.\n\n\nGetting Leads (10 mins)\n\nLeadhype: https://leadhype.com/\n\nThis is our go-to software at the moment. It works best if you have LinkedIn Sales Navigator so I recommend getting it. We like to separate leads into batches based on locations.\n\nIf we\u2019re targeting gym owners, we\u2019re going to be creating separate jobs on Leadhype. Gym Owners (LA), Gym Owners (NYC) etc. This way they\u2019re all in the same time-zone and we can schedule emails to them easily later.\n\n+ Great for getting bulk leads from LinkedIn.\n+ Easy to use.\n+ You can get up to 150K Leads monthly.\n+ You\u2019re scraping leads for yourself, you\u2019re not using leads that everybody has access to.\n\n- Not as targeted\n- Not the best option for finding very specific leads (based on revenue)\n\nApollo: https://www.apollo.io/\n\nThey have a huge database of B2B leads and you can filter them with tens of filters like revenue, employee count, niche, tech stack etc.\n\n+ Great Database\n+ Great Filters\n\n- The main plan allows you to export 25 leads at a time.\nCleaning Leads (5 mins)\n\nhttps://bulkemailchecker.com\n\nIf we\u2019re not in a rush this is our go-to. It\u2019s quite slow but the cheapest.\n\n+ Cheap\n\n- Slow\nOn the left-hand side select Bulk Verify.\n\n\nOn the right-hand side select This file contains multiple columns of data in a csv spreadsheet. Select the file with your leads and click Upload.\n\nWait 2-3 minutes for the next window to appear and click the green button Check Status. \nSelect the column with the email address. In this case because we got the lead list from Leadhype it\u2019s the column corporate email. Click the green button Select.\nWait 5 minutes until the next window appears to start the validation process. \nClick the green button to start the validation process. We recommend the slower validation method since it is significantly cheaper. \n\nOnce the lead list has finished validating and you have exported the lead list from Bulkemailchecker make sure to format and clean it before sending emails.\n \nYou do that by only keeping the rows that say \u201cThe address passed all tests\u201d in the Details column (the last column all the way to the right). Remove any rows that don\u2019t say The address passed all tests, such as Dupe., The address does not have a valid dns., None., Is a Catchall mx server config., Greylisting is active on this server. Etc.\n\nThe following step-by-step instructions show you how to do this fast and accurately. \nUpload the .csv to your GDrive as a Google Sheet. Apply filters on the entire sheet. \nOnce the filter is applied to the entire sheet go to the column Details. Click on the filter symbol inside of that column header. Click Clear and type in the search box passed so you can find all email addresses that have passed the validation stage. Click on the result and press OK. \nSelect all, copy and paste into a new sheet inside the same spreadsheet. Add -only-passed at the end of the new sheet name where you pasted in the results.\nDelete the original tab/sheet so you only have the [NAME]-only-passed sheet left in the spreadsheet.\n\nThis makes sure that you\u2019re only sending to valid emails and keeping your spam score low. Once you\u2019ve done that you are ready to proceed and start sending in Instantly :)\n\n\nhttps://www.zerobounce.net/\n\n+ Faster\n- More Expensive.\n\nMake sure that the lead list that you\u2019re going to upload on the next step only contains the validated emails and not the negative results. \nSetting Up The Campaign With Instantly\n\nWe use Instantly because you can connect unlimited email accounts (it\u2019s not pay per account like most similar software) and it\u2019s the easiest software to use (because we built it like that).\n\nCreate a free trial account here.\n\nConnecting Email Accounts (10 mins)\n\nSimply connect all your emails with Instantly here: https://app.instantly.ai/app/account/connect\n\nWe recommend using 2FA whenever possible because it\u2019s much more secure and stable. \n\nUploading Leads (1 min)\n\nJust upload all the cleaned leads via CSV.\n\n\n\nSetting Up The Sequence (5 mins)\n\nEmail Copy\n\nKeep your emails short and sweet. We don\u2019t use any links. Try pattern interrupts and get creative. Don\u2019t send that boring shit that everybody\u2019s sending.\nHere are a bunch of great cold email sequences from Lemlist users.\nHere\u2019s another list of cold email templates from Hunter.io\n\nFor first lines we recommend Listkit. \n\nWe use a 3 step sequence. \n\nStep 1 - Initial Cold Email.\n\n\nStep 2 - Quick bump.\n\nStep 3 - Break-up Email.\n\n\n\nScheduling (1 min)\n\nHere just start with work-hours in the time zone where your leads for this campaign are located at. \n\n\nAdvanced Options (1 min)\n\nEmails To Use - Just select all the accounts for this campaign you want to use. This is the real superpower of Instantly. It will start sending emails from all of these accounts automatically. \nStop sending emails on reply - Stops the sequence for the user who has replied. This is recommended.\n\n\nSmart Sending - This will send emails as close to a human as possible. It will vary the pause before emails to make it look organic and natural. Also it will start ramping email up slowly.\nDaily Sending Limit - We recommend sending max 30-50 emails a day for best results, so just multiply your added accounts in this campaign by 30 to set this number.\nThat\u2019s it. Now you can launch your campaign.\n\nCongrats! Instantly will start sending out emails every day automatically from all your connected accounts and you just need to keep an eye on the campaigns.\nOptimizing & Scaling\n\nAnalyzing Campaigns\nUse the Analytics Tab to keep an eye on your campaigns and pause the ones that aren\u2019t delivering results.\n\n\n\nBenchmarks\n\nWe want to hit:\n\n50% Open Rate\n5+% Reply Rate\n\nIf the open rate is lower, try a different subject line and make sure your emails are not getting stuck in spam. If they are in spam, pause the campaign for a couple of days and let the warm-up run until you\u2019re out of spam.\n\nIf the reply rate is lower, change your email copy and/or targeting. It can take a couple of different tests until you find a working combo.\n\nScaling Up\n\nScaling up is super easy. Just create more domains/email accounts, and add them to your Instantly campaign and increase the daily sending limit.\n\nFeel free to send this tutorial to VA\u2019s and just have them set up as many domains and emails as you need.\nThe End. Feedback & Suggestions\n\nThat\u2019s it.

{"category": "ranking", "instruction": "rearrange the following paragraphs in logical order without losing their references and citations; detail answer is expected\n\nThere is growing concern globally about environmental sustainability due to the rapid increase in population and human activities impacting the environment. Research has been emerging to address these impacts, with a particular focus on environmental pollution. Air pollution is a major result of environmental degradation, primarily generated by urban population growth, industrial activities, and vehicle emissions (Tella and Balogun 2021). Air pollution occurs when pollutants in the atmosphere exceed safe levels, impacting human health (Bozda\u011f et al. 2020). The effects of air pollution are evident in the correlation between the rise in hospitalization and mortality rates due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (Schornobay-Lui et al. 2019). Long-term exposure to poor air quality can reduce lung function in children (Halim et al. 2020) and increase lung disease in adults (Lasheras et al. 2020). Particular attention has been given to particulate matter (PM), particularly PM10 and PM2.5 (Park et al. 2018; Lu 2020), due to their small size, which allows for easy penetration into human lungs (Schornobay-Lui et al. 2019; Di Antonio et al. 2019). PM10 refers to particulate matter that is equal to or finer than 10 \u03bcm in diameter. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has predicted that there will be an increase in premature deaths related to PM globally, reaching 3.6 million by 2050 (OECD 2012). The predicted impact of PM is likely to be exacerbated by projected population growth and increased urbanization in the future. This is because PM10 is primarily sourced from urban areas with excessive carbonaceous emissions from traffic and fossil fuel combustion, as well as wildfires (Tosun 2017). Given the tendency for increased PM10 emissions due to the continuous increase in world population (UN 2014) and unplanned urbanization, air quality will likely deteriorate if not properly managed. Therefore, it is important to accurately identify areas with high PM10 concentrations and the factors contributing to its formation, transportation, and distribution, which remain a challenge, particularly in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. In the literature, different approaches have been adopted to predict the concentration of PM10.\n\nDeterministic methods such as community multi-scale air quality (CMAQ) (Gao et al. 2020) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (Vongruang et al. 2017) are widely used for predicting particulate matter. However, limitations such as the small size of the dataset, low predictive performance for small areas, and the high computational cost (Ma et al. 2020a) have affected the reliability of these models. Also, this approach depends on pollutant sources and emission data, which are scarce (Song et al. 2015). The absence of these variables will affect the outcome, resulting in bias-error and uncertainty in air pollution estimation (Taheri and Sodoudi 2016).Another model that has been widely used for predicting PM10 is the statistical model, such as linear regression (Tzanis et al. 2019). Although linear regression has exhibited better performance than the deterministic method, it has been attributed to the nonlinearity problem (Ma et al. 2020a). Emergent models, especially machine learning techniques, have solved non-linearity with better predictive performance and less computational cost than the deterministic and linear regression models (Suleiman et al. 2020). Machine learning solves the linearity problem since it is not necessary for the predictors to be linearly correlated with the response to predict the label accurately. The use of machine learning techniques in air pollution modeling has become common in recent times (Tejasvini et al. 2020; Althuwaynee et al. 2020). Despite ML techniques\u2019 success, their prediction is limited to the levels of fixed monitoring stations (Xu et al. 2018). There is little consideration of spatial patterns, distribution, trends, and behavior of pollutants in existing studies (Choubin et al. 2020). This prevalent approach, which considers only the fixed monitoring stations without modeling the pollutants\u2019 spatial dimension, has limited our understanding of the spatial distribution, air pollution hotspots, and the level of air pollution within the environs. Thus, combining ML and GIS ensures a better understanding and interpretation of air pollution levels than using ML models alone.information system (GIS) is a versatile tool that is appropriate for estimating air pollutants and their spatial distribution at a low computational cost (Requia et al. 2019) with better visualization, which aids the decision-making process. Spatial mapping techniques such as land use regression models (LUR), the geostatistical interpolation method, and dispersion models have been used to estimate, predict, and map air pollution because of their better interpretation, visualization, and understanding of prediction outcomes. However, high uncertainties are usually attributed to geostatistical analysis, especially due to the scarce or uneven distribution of data values (Tian 2016). Leveraging detailed data such as roads, land use, and buildings, Lim et al. (2019) used geospatial data acquired from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) to predict the PM2.5 level in Seoul, Korea. The resultant maps enable better understanding and interpretation of the levels of PM2.5 in the area. Compared to interpolation techniques, LUR is suitable for small areas with limited monitoring stations. However, LUR models are basically valuable when the data is sufficient. These models and techniques are important for Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for understanding and predicting the concentration of PM10 and making better decisions to mitigate the effects of air pollution by identifying the sources of pollutants and the areas with high PM10 concentrations, as well as the causal factors contributing to the formation, transportation, and distribution of this pollutant, which remains a challenge. By integrating GIS with machine learning techniques, better understanding and interpretation of air pollution levels can be achieved, which can aid in decision-making and the devising of effective mitigation strategies to improve air quality in the city of Addis Ababa.\nThe increase in urbanization, industrialization, transportation, population, and fossil fuel emissions in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia has greatly affected the air quality in the area (Bozdag et al., 2020). Air pollution is a significant environmental problem in developing countries, particularly in Addis Ababa, whose goal is to become industrialized soon (Juneng et al., 2009). According to research, Addis Ababa is ranked among the countries with the worst air quality (Kamarul Zaman et al., 2017). The spatial location of Addis Ababa along the emitted pollutants' pathway has also contributed to air pollution (Reid et al., 2013), specifically from forest fires and transboundary pollution (Usmani et al., 2020).\n\nIn Addis Ababa, the Air Pollution Index (API) is calculated using the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM) with a diameter finer than 10 \u03bcm and PM2.5 (APIMS 2019). Despite the current use of PM2.5 to indicate the API level in Addis Ababa (APIMS 2020), PM10 sourced from vehicles' soot, biomass burning, and industrial emissions remains a threat to health (Khan et al., 2016) due to its small aerodynamic particulate diameter which can easily penetrate the lungs and respiratory system, resulting in adverse health effects (Tella and Balogun, 2021).\n\nThe impact of exposure to PM10 has been discussed in several literature, causing cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, asthma, birth defects, cerebrovascular health problems, global warming, rise in hospitalization, absenteeism in school, mortality, morbidity, and potential carcinogenicity (Bergstrom et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Feng et al., 2019). Additionally, particulate matter is a causative factor of haze in Addis Ababa, affecting the socio-economic developments, tourism sector, school activities, and cardiovascular system of both young and old (Song et al., 2019).\n\nThere has been a rise in the concentration of PM10 in Addis Ababa's atmosphere due to frequent vehicular emission, industrial emission, and urbanization (Althuwaynee et al., 2020). Thus, the high concentration of ambient PM10 has been a major environmental concern that requires quick intervention. An essential aspect of effective air quality management is the ability to accurately identify potential hotspots of PM10 concentration for preemptive monitoring and timely control measures. Reliable estimation of the PM10 hazard level will aid mitigation strategies by providing timely information to stakeholders, decision-makers, and government to curb the impacts of air pollution (Fortelli et al., 2016). Considering that poor air quality is projected to increase due to unplanned population growth and socio-economic activities (She et al., 2017), studies that aim to advance ongoing initiatives to accurately predict future PM10 concentration leveraging advancements in geospatial technology and digitalization are essential.\n\nNotably, some studies have been carried out towards reducing the impact of PM10 in Addis Ababa. However, according to a review of studies that carried out PM10 modeling in Addis Ababa by (Shaziayani et al., 2020), it was established that 72% of these studies used linear regression methods, while only 12% used non-linear machine learning techniques. For instance, Juneng et al. (2009) examined the spatiotemporal variation of PM10 in Addis Ababa using principal component analysis (PCA) to understand the variability of PM10 concentration. The authors combined the principal component with spatial tools to create the principal component spatial loadings in order to understand the spatial and temporal variability of PM10 concentration in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. However, recent studies that aimed to predict PM10 concentration have mostly used a linear regression model (Abdullah et al. 2017, 2020; Fong et al., 2018). Additionally, many of these studies have used meteorological variables as predictors, such as Alifa et al. (2020) who used stepwise multiple linear regression and meteorological data to predict PM10 concentration in Malaysia. Although linear regression has been shown to have a good performance in determining the relationship between climatic variables and PM10 (Tella et al., 2021), it has limitations in accounting for non-linearity and the complex relationship between spatial and temporal predictors and PM10 (Chen et al., 2018). Furthermore, linear regression models often fail to integrate heterogeneous variables such as road density and building data that can affect air pollution (Wen et al., 2019).\n\nOne effective solution to these limitations is the use of machine learning techniques, which are not restricted by the non-linear problem and the complexity of the relationship between predictors and PM10 (Hu et al., 2017). Although there have been limited studies on using machine learning to predict PM10 in Ethiopia, this approach has been widely utilized in other countries with high performance and accuracy. For example, Chen et al. (2018) used the random forest to accurately predict PM10 concentration, with the model explaining 82% of the variability of the air pollutant in China. Additionally, Suleiman et al. (2020) developed models based on random forest, deep learning, and extreme learning machine to model roadside PM10 and PM2.5 in London, with R2 values of the models above 0.80.\n\nGiven the remarkable performance of machine learning techniques, integrating them with spatial technology can help stakeholders identify locations that are most susceptible to air pollution in Addis Ababa. Therefore, this study aims to develop three different machine learning models: Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB) to predict PM10 spatial hazard hotspots in Addis Ababa. To the best of the authors' knowledge, these three models have not been used to predict air pollution comparatively, making this study the first of its kind in Ethiopia. Furthermore, the inclusion of spatial modeling enhances the approach adopted in this study, with the objectives of the study being: (i) spatial prediction of PM10 hazard hotspots (ii) determination of variable importance of the predictors (iii) comparison of the models in the prediction of PM10 hotspots", "input": ""}

{"category": "solving_exam_question_with_math", "instruction": "Often in practice, hyper-parameters are chosen by trial-and-error based on a model evaluation criterion. Instead, {\\textit gradient-based hyper-parameter optimization} computes gradient of the evaluation criterion w.r.t. the hyper-parameters and uses this gradient to directly optimize for the best set of hyper-parameters. For this problem, we will optimize for the learning rate of gradient descent in a regularized linear regression problem.\n \nSpecifically, given $n$ pairs of input data with $d$ features and scalar label $(\\mathbf{x}\\_i,t\\_i)\\in\\mathbb{R} ^{d}\\times\\mathbb{R}$, we wish to find a linear model $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\hat{\\mathbf{w}}^\\top\\mathbf{x}$ with $\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$ and a L2 penalty, $\\lambda \\|\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}^2\\_2\\|$, that minimizes the squared error of prediction on the training samples. $\\lambda$ is a hyperparameter that modulates the impact of the L2 regularization on the loss function. Using the concise notation for the data matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ and the corresponding label vector $\\mathbf{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, the squared error loss can be written as:\n \\begin{align\\*}\n \\Tilde{\\loss}\n = \n \\frac{1}{n}\\| X \\hat{\\mathbf{w}} - \\mathbf{t} \\|\\_2^2 + \\lambda \\|\\hat{\\mathbf{w}}\\|\\_2^2.\n \\end{align\\*}\n \n Starting with an initial weight parameters $\\mathbf{w}\\_0$, gradient descent (GD) updates $\\mathbf{w}\\_0$ with a learning rate $\\eta$ for $t$ number of iterations. Let's denote the weights after $t$ iterations of GD as $\\mathbf{w}\\_t$, the loss as $\\loss\\_t$, and its gradient as $\\nabla\\_{\\mathbf{w}\\_t}$. The goal is the find the optimal learning rate by following the gradient of $\\loss\\_t$ w.r.t. the learning rate $\\eta$.\nThen, consider a case of $t$ iterations of GD. What is the memory complexity for the forward-propagation in terms of $t$?

{"category": "classification_identification", "instruction": "Can you tell whether the following text is generated by AI?\nObesity is a major public health problem worldwide. It is a condition characterized by excessive body fat accumulation, which can lead to various health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. One of the leading causes of obesity is the overconsumption of unhealthy foods.\n\nIn today's society, we are surrounded by a vast array of food options, from fast food to processed snacks. These foods are often high in calories, sugar, and unhealthy fats, making them very appealing to our taste buds. However, consuming these foods regularly can lead to weight gain and ultimately, obesity.\n\nFast food, in particular, is known to be a major contributor to obesity. It is typically high in calories, sugar, and unhealthy fats, and low in nutrients. Regularly consuming fast food can lead to weight gain and an increased risk of developing obesity-related diseases. Additionally, fast food is often cheaper and more convenient than healthier options, making it an attractive choice for people on a tight budget or with a busy lifestyle.\n\nProcessed foods are another major contributor to obesity. These foods are often high in calories, sugar, and unhealthy fats, and contain a range of artificial additives. They are designed to be highly palatable and addictive, making it difficult for people to resist overeating them. Furthermore, processed foods often lack the nutrients that our bodies need to function properly, leaving us feeling hungry and unsatisfied after eating.\n\nTo combat obesity, it is important to make healthy food choices. A healthy diet should consist of a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. These foods are nutrient-dense, which means they provide our bodies with the nutrients they need to function properly, without adding excess calories.\n\nIn conclusion, the overconsumption of unhealthy foods is a major contributor to the obesity epidemic. Fast food and processed foods are often high in calories, sugar, and unhealthy fats, and lack the nutrients that our bodies need to function properly. Making healthy food choices is essential in combating obesity and improving overall health.", "input": ""}

In addition to being the first leader of the new United States of America, he was a leader in the American Revolution and an early statesman.\n\nGeorge Washington was born in Virginia on February 22, 1732. He was the first child of Augustine and Mary Washington and grew up with five siblings. His father died when he was 11 and his mother left him with his older brother to take care of the farm. This gave Washington the opportunity to pursue his dreams of becoming a military leader and a statesman.\n\nWashington entered the Virginia militia in 1753 and was quickly promoted to official rank. He served with distinction in the French and Indian War, eventually rising to be Colonel. After the war, Washington was elected to the Virginia legislature and quickly began to become a figure of politics in the region. He then went on to be a key figure in the Revolution and a leader of the Continental Army. He was appointed Commander of the Revolutionary forces by the Continental Congress in 1781, and he eventually defeated the British Army at Yorktown.\n\nAfter the Revolution, Washington was an instrumental figure in the development of the United States government. He was elected the first President of the United States in 1789 and served two terms until 1797. During his presidency, Washington established several important precedents. He championed religious freedom, the separation of powers, and the independence of the judiciary.\n\nGeorge Washington was an important figure in the history of the United States and is respected as one of its fathers. He set several important precedents during his two terms as president, and his actions and leadership during the American Revolution were crucial to the new nation's success. He is remembered today as a leader of courage and wisdom and is a symbol of the United States of America.\"", "input": ""}

(2016) was able to come up with the conclusion that food production in the Philippines will decrease by 4% by 2050. One of the factors that cause the decline of food production is that climate change disturbs the weather pattern of the local area which makes farmers have a hard time selecting the best time to plant and harvest the crops. Tol, R. S. J. (2018), explained that in the short and medium term, climate change may seem to be beneficial for countries that depend on rain-fed agriculture. In the long-term and for the sustainability of the Earth, climate change only brings negative effects which will have a substantial impact on countries experiencing poverty. Carbon tax was developed to combat poverty vulnerability, though this might lead to a decrease in economic growth. Due to this reason, the implementation of a carbon tax should be carefully considered. Therefore, climate-resilient agriculture should be prioritized for stable food production in the Philippines. Climate change affects all aspects of nations. Although agriculture experiences the most drastic of effects, research and development towards this topic should be on high alert.", "input": ""}

Roran was curled up on the floor with a blanket and pillow as his mother read him fairytales. Her voice was soft and warm, like the fire, and it wrapped around Roran like a hug. He loved evenings like this. He loved listening to his mother tell stories and the scratching of his father\u2019s quill. He often joined them for stories and the three spent most of their evenings in this room before Roran was sent to bed.\nRoran was the only child of King Daris and Queen Jaelin. He knew they wished to give him siblings, but for reasons he didn\u2019t understand, they wouldn\u2019t. So they showered him in as much love as they had to give. And he was happy. Even at the young age of four years old, he knew how much they loved him and he loved them. Even though they were King and Queen, they spent as much time as they could with him, including times like this.\nBut this evening took a surprising turn. The door to the library burst open and Mage Kevala was standing in the doorway, a shocked look on her face.\n\u201cYour Majesties!\u201d\n\u201cKevala? What is the meaning of disrupting us at this hour?\u201d King Daris stood from the small desk where he had been writing, his voice angry.\nRoran sat up. Kevala looked like she was about to cry and it struck Roran as odd. She had always been so strict and controlled. It was weird to see her emotions so open. Roran, suddenly scared, ran over to his mother and she drew him up into her lap, comforting him with a hug.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Greschel.\u201d\nThe King\u2019s anger disappeared, \u201cGreschel? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nKevala looked back and forth between the King and Queen and she revealed a folded parchment. Roran pulled away a little from his mother\u2019s embrace, his curiosity winning out over his fear. The King took the parchment, and even in the dim light of the fire, Roran could see the colour drain from his face.\n\u201cGreschel is\u2026 dead!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The Queen\u2019s arms loosened around Roran and her mouth had dropped open.\nRoran\u2019s father turned around, his face blank with grief, \u201cHe had decided to travel north alone, before his company was ready to travel with him. He got sick and died before the healer could get there. I don\u2019t understand. How could this happen?\u201d\nThe room went quiet. Greschel had been the High Mage of Ascai and advisor to their majesties. Roran didn\u2019t really know Greschel. The few times he had met the man, it had been brief, rather scary encounters. Greschel was tall and wore a scowl like his father wore a smile; all the time. Roran hadn\u2019t liked him too much and always felt that Greschel had been watching him, disappointment and displeasure surrounding him like a cloud.\nBut Roran knew that his parents had liked him and their grief filled the room.\nRoran looked at Kevala. She looked back at him, fear in her eyes. As the King walked back over to the Queen, Kevala raised a hand like she was going to say something, but seemed to decide not to and stayed quiet. Her eyes lingered on Roran and he shifted uncomfortably in his mother\u2019s lap, her frightened gaze igniting a new fear in Roran, though he couldn\u2019t understand why. He turned back to his mother, who now had silent tears running down her face. He leaned into her and let her wrap her arms around him as she cried.\n\n####\n\nFeedback in CSV format:", "input": ""}

{"category": "language_polishing", "instruction": "please improve the following text.\n\nPhysics-based three-dimensional (3D) modeling, together with data-driven deep learning, can be successfully exploited to extract knowledge to aid drug design and protein engineering. A huge number of Protein-Protein Interfaces (PPIs) are available in the form of both experimentally and computationally obtained PDB 3D coordinates files, representing a significant pool of data for training deep learning models aided in predicting biologically relevant tasks. We previously developed DeepRank and DeepRank-GNN, two deep learning frameworks for PPIs data mining using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), respectively. We present here DeepRank-Core, a unified and user-friendly deep learning framework that converts 3D representations of PPIs into graphs, which can be further used to efficiently train CNN and/or GNN architectures. DeepRank-Core is designed to be an easily customizable deep learning pipeline that offers the ability to use two of the most powerful deep learning architectures available, depending on the problem-specific interaction patterns that the user intends to model. We demonstrate DeepRank-Core\u2019s performance in an application of personalized cancer vaccines by modeling peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes and predicting their Binding Affinities (BAs), the understanding of which plays a key role in determining which patient\u2019s mutated tumor peptides are best suited as vaccine candidates. With preliminary experiments, we demonstrate not only a highly competitive performance in this task compared to state-of-the art methods, confident of wide room for improvement, but also a significant gain in speed, storage requirements, and usability compared to DeepRank and DeepRank-GNN.

Okay. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (00:37)\nCool. Let me just. What am I doing. Just go share a screen. There it is. Okay. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (00:51)\nOkay. Cool. Let's start with Cyrus. \nCyrus Collier (01:03)\nYou can move. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (01:06)\nThe engage thing to in progress that's that. The bottom of there and the criterion. \nCyrus Collier (01:11)\nI just moved in. I'm gonna Criterion week done. Okay. And then. I have to do with the BA stuff. I guess they're all just kind of neural and beta. \nCyrus Collier (01:26)\nGravity plus thing. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (01:30)\nWednesday. Yep. They scheduled it. I saw that. \nCyrus Collier (01:35)\nYeah, I'm hoping to have that engaged thing actually wrapped up today. I didn't get to it on a Friday because there was some criterion issues, but Dev one environment was down. \nCyrus Collier (01:46)\nFriday, but. While taking all that stuff. But it's actually good that I waited, because then I realized I didn't actually have to go through the trouble of writing a whole, like, script. To do this. I can just do it with some equal queries. So I'm just testing it out right now and then I can just run those. \nCyrus Collier (02:05)\nEnvironments and be done with it. That's good, nice and clean. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (02:16)\nCool. Spence. \nVincent Ragosta (02:22)\nI wrapped up. The ABM stuff. I'm just pulling over here. I wrap OB on Friday, and I did the redirect stuff. I know there was an additional redirect for either Oklahoma or OSM, \nKevin Fitzpatrick (02:32)\nwhich I will handle. Okay. \nVincent Ragosta (02:34)\nWhen I get back and then I know the older contact forms came back as well from QA. So I will be addressing that as well today. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (02:44)\nOh, yeah, miles, did you do your key way on those yet. \nMiles Morton (02:48)\nOn which one Avian contact forms. \nMiles Morton (02:51)\nNo, \nKevin Fitzpatrick (02:52)\nI haven't done my QA on the contact form. Okay, so that would just be something. Vince, you could probably hold until Miles takes a look. So this way you could just do it all at once. \nVincent Ragosta (03:03)\nOkay. No problem. Is pictures from home ready to work? \nKevin Fitzpatrick (03:10)\nOh, no. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (03:12)\nMilestones today. \nVincent Ragosta (03:15)\nOkay. So then I seem light at the moment. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (03:18)\nUnless there's anything. How about the studio? \nVincent Ragosta (03:20)\nYou done with the studio, right. \nJeremy Strom (03:26)\nThere's also this task that you put on me, Kevin. Without you I think we talked about. \nJeremy Strom (03:34)\nEvents doing an initial pass on that. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (03:39)\nOkay. All right, so that would be a priority. Today, \nVincent Ragosta (03:44)\nthen. Okay. So then focus on out over studio. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (03:49)\nYeah. I mean, John asked about the studio on Friday website, so I'm like getting a little. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (03:54)\nNervy about that. But we could. Yeah. \nDonald Deane (03:57)\nWithout you would be definitely be the priority. Kev, I forget it's. Without you the one that has to be done on the cheap. \nJeremy Strom (04:09)\nThere's a wireframe right that Miles made. \nJeremy Strom (04:13)\nSo, Vince, what I was thinking is basically. There are, you know, pages and components and content that needs to be. Scaffolded out. You know, like the NAV. Navs, burger and header stuff. Media Carousel, I think. \nJeremy Strom (04:35)\nThings like that that instead of making a whole design. Of all the pages and everything. We would just Dev it out and. The user our best judgment and design. To do what we can? Oh, yeah? We calendar. \nJeremy Strom (04:57)\nAnd. Then. Miles would give feedback on changes. Does site exist already and have a color palette already? It does. Yeah. There's a landing page that has those two those two buttons VIP tickets and Get tickets, which currently are part of the page content. So that needs to be moved into. \nJeremy Strom (05:20)\nThe header. Component. And adding a menu. There is already I already built a quote rotator on that page that was never. It ended up not being used. I think so that component should already be there with styled arrows and everything. \nJeremy Strom (05:44)\nSo you'll want to look for that. But yeah, hopefully we can just kind of. You know, scaffold out the components and content with some default. You know, styles that are consistent with the existing. Style Guide and. \nJeremy Strom (06:11)\nLet me just go from there. So the idea is to do it as just as quickly as possible. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (06:17)\nYeah. \nVincent Ragosta (06:17)\nThere's 16 hours to do this. And. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (06:22)\nI don't know how many you have. I don't know, Jeremy, how much you plan up. But there's also a media page, \nVincent Ragosta (06:26)\nVince. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (06:27)\nThere's a menu that we're gonna have to do because the site doesn't have a menu. And there's an about page. \nMiles Morton (06:34)\nKevin, did you say that the Media pit, that the media page had to. Have. News articles because that wasn't in the nodes, \nKevin Fitzpatrick (06:44)\nand I didn't put it in the wire. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (06:45)\nNo, the media. Yes, you're right. The media page did have to have news articles. \nMiles Morton (06:49)\nOkay. It's not in any of the documentation. Was that just relayed to you. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (06:54)\nNo, no, it wasn't a documentation. It was in the original spec. I read. \nMiles Morton (06:58)\nSo. I guess I couldn't. I didn't see it. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (07:02)\nBut so it's just like a was in the Google document. \nMiles Morton (07:06)\nThumbnails and links to articles. Yeah, I guess. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (07:11)\nI mean, I hate that or not. Thumbnails. \nMiles Morton (07:13)\nWe can't use thumbnails. So don't you slinks links to articles? Yeah. \nMiles Morton (07:19)\nStupid. Okay. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (07:23)\nOh, wait a second. Was that this may not be the same thing. I think that's pictures from home we're talking about. \nMiles Morton (07:28)\nOh, okay. I'm getting confused. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (07:30)\nYeah, I'm getting them confused, too. I just look over the spec again. But it is pictures from home. That may be that because that's Jeffrey Richards, and he's like, \nMiles Morton (07:37)\nreally old school. Okay. Like old school. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (07:41)\nHe once called the Computer the Google machine. He's very, very proud of his old so. And he's also old. \nDonald Deane (07:57)\nTo me the first time my mom used a computer, she picked up the mouse, and she tried speaking into, Is that the most boomeranish thing you've ever heard in your entire life? \nKevin Fitzpatrick (08:04)\nHello. She's saying it to the mouse. \nJeremy Strom (08:06)\nNothing's. Kind of futuristic. \nDonald Deane (08:09)\nIt is right. Righted, \nKevin Fitzpatrick (08:13)\none. \nCyrus Collier (08:14)\nShe probably got it from Star Trek Four. That's a Scottie. \nDonald Deane (08:17)\nThat's what Scottie doesn't. Surgery, right. Right. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (08:20)\nMy flying cars. Next. \nCyrus Collier (08:23)\nHe sits down to like, an old Mac Plus or something. And this. Oh, that's right. That's right. They start this talking to her like a computer, \nDonald Deane (08:30)\ndo they. \nCyrus Collier (08:32)\nGuys like, you know? And then, like, I think I think McCoy, hands in the mouse. \nDonald Deane (08:37)\nYou hold it up. Hello, computer. You're right. Wow. \nCyrus Collier (08:40)\nMemory unlocked. And then the girl. And then the guy, like, the engineer guy in the warehouse, is like, just use the keyboard. And then he says, the keyboard, how Queen. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (08:48)\nIt starts like typing a mile a minute. \nCyrus Collier (08:52)\nOh, my God. \nMiles Morton (08:54)\nWas Dawn's Mom just making a Star Trek reference? \nDonald Deane (08:56)\nNo, she wasn't. That's. \nMiles Morton (08:59)\nAre you sure? Maybe you just. No, I'm not now. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (09:02)\nI'm not sure. \nDonald Deane (09:06)\nMy mom, my mom is pretty bad. \nDonald Deane (09:08)\nI swear she wasn't my mom's, not that hip. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (09:11)\nShe really isn't. \nJeremy Strom (09:15)\nSo, so, Vince, as far as a first pass, if you're just thinking in terms of. Back end and CMS. What do you what are you thinking? I was thinking for for that part of it maybe like 6 hours, tops. \nVincent Ragosta (09:38)\nBut that's excluding any. The 16 hours. It all makes sense. I have to look at the wireframe. \nJeremy Strom (09:47)\nIt's kind of tough. Yeah, they're here. I'm showing them on my screen. Yeah. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (09:50)\nVincent's on his phone, though. So. \nVincent Ragosta (09:52)\nYeah, I don't see it being that that big. \nJeremy Strom (09:57)\nProblem. Will just stay in touch on it as it goes and keep an eye on your hours. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (10:07)\nYeah. Because we wanted to do a whole design phase. We normally do. And they were just like we just didn't. They didn't have the money to do that. Now. I said, okay, well, we could do, like the Express Lane. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (10:18)\nYou know, and then that's what they approved. And we felt okay about doing the Express Lane because it was already an established site, \nDonald Deane (10:27)\nespecially. And I love it. \nJeremy Strom (10:28)\nYeah. They're trying to squeeze out a 20K for ten. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (10:31)\nYeah. Well, a lot of clients do that. They're crazy. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (10:34)\nNot only that the account team has gone, you know what? I kind of like it because I don't want to be working on a site for so long. \nJeremy Strom (10:42)\nI just want them done. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (10:44)\nWell, we'll knock it out and see how it goes. I mean, the only downside to something like this is if the site didn't have, like, an established look. But you remember when we first started this whole. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (10:54)\nOrchestrator thing like the idea was to build a under 20K site. Any idea that was Miles would just do a home page and kind of work with you guys on the rest of it. Because all the components kind of where the same. \nCyrus Collier (11:14)\nThing is. On our data show that like our analytics show that Besides the homepage and the tickets page like not a lot of people you need to go to the other pages. A third of the budget. Building out this awesome Catholic Creative page. \nDonald Deane (11:30)\nNobody ever sees. Media. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (11:33)\nYeah. And I think Pippa also said Miles, that we could start moving on WWI speaking of other pages like FAQ and. Home page. I mean that again would be. In the express Lane because they don't have a lot of money. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (11:49)\nSo I would almost just go in Dev and do that, like, do something. I mean, we know what they look like, right. But maybe, you know, you could probably just do a design and just match the styles up or whatever, because I figure this client, despite it being in the Express laying, he doesn't know it's in the Express Lane. He thinks he's like pouring out his life's fortune for this website at 1210. \nMiles Morton (12:11)\n\u00a30. \nMiles Morton (12:12)\nWell, we're not. We're not gonna work on we will rock you today, \nKevin Fitzpatrick (12:17)\nright? No. \nMiles Morton (12:17)\nNow we could talk about tomorrow and the next day, but, yeah, \nKevin Fitzpatrick (12:20)\nI think maybe let's just let's just keep focusing. \nMiles Morton (12:23)\nHow the schedule shake out and who has time? Because. \nMiles Morton (12:26)\nI. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (12:28)\nRight now, I'm sort of booked up, but then I've been really slow, so, yeah, no, I'm guaranteeing you by Wednesday will be slow again. \nMiles Morton (12:36)\nYeah. So I don't want to. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (12:38)\nOkay, let's just revisit it. All right. Cool. Kept. \nDonald Deane (12:41)\nShould we mention Friday at all? Since we have a yeah. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (12:45)\nYeah. We kind of have a dilemma because Don. \nJeremy Strom (12:48)\nIs out and I'm out on Friday. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (12:53)\nWe don't know yet but. We've asked. Or I've asked. So. In that case. Just trying to think. Like who covers what? Like when something comes in. I think I just wouldn't make it clear to the account team to go directly to whoever is working on it. Like development wise. Her design was. \nDonald Deane (13:17)\nSo for stuff that might drag, like pictures from Home without you, we were Rocky. While that sort of stuff that we expect end of week. \nMiles Morton (13:30)\nIs the answer. But would it be good to bring in Dan in just a couple of meetings. \nMiles Morton (13:34)\nTowards the end of the week if him billion. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (13:38)\nProbably not. \nDonald Deane (13:39)\nNo, no. Okay. I've made that suggestion. It was told. No. \nMiles Morton (13:45)\nJust checking. \nDonald Deane (13:47)\nSo we're kind of limited in terms of who's been approved to actually support for Kevin and I when we're out, but we'll see what Alicia says. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (13:54)\nWe put the question, yeah, because there are. \nDonald Deane (13:55)\nThere's always going to be instances done when we're both out. Oh, yeah, I know, I know. It just happens to be, you know? \nKevin Fitzpatrick (14:01)\nYep, Yep. \nJeremy Strom (14:03)\nHow about bill. \nMiles Morton (14:07)\nYeah, Bill would be the most obvious alternative, \nKevin Fitzpatrick (14:10)\nbut. I don't think well, you are actually up to speed on Advantage and all that stuff. \nBill Rousseau (14:17)\nBy choice. I apologize. It was multitasking in the background. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (14:20)\nWhat do you need help with? No, I'm just saying. Me and Donna both gonna be out on Friday. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (14:26)\nAnd. You know, people may want to know, like who's gonna cover projects if we're not both here. Yeah, just give me a heads up and happy to help, okay. All right. Well, we could say that to Don if you know, but it it will be maybe once or twice a year that's something like that would happen. \nDonald Deane (14:44)\nYeah. I don't. I mean, whether nothing like, \nKevin Fitzpatrick (14:47)\nyou know, a week long or something, \nDonald Deane (14:49)\nyou know. So no. And we've had we've had periods where you and I are covering for each other. And we don't even inform the larger team, and everything is fine. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (14:56)\nSo I don't that's what they don't want. \nDonald Deane (14:59)\nI know I don't want to, but I don't want to do this in a silos. So I think we you were right in reaching out to Alicia with this KEF. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (15:05)\nOkay. Formalized with her or whatever, however, she wants us to handle. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (15:09)\nOkay. Holly Road. US too. \nDonald Deane (15:15)\nIt's like everybody's just so alarmed. I know. I saw. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (15:19)\nIt's not even that busy. Jesus, \nDonald Deane (15:22)\nwhat are we gonna do on Friday? We're both out. Holy crap. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (15:25)\nNo, I can work. I mean, \nDonald Deane (15:27)\nI could. I just prefer not to. I'd rather you didn't know. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (15:30)\nI would rather I did any. Let's see what Alicia comes. You need to be there for the wife. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (15:35)\nYeah. All right. And both of these things are, you know, we're out because. Not for a vacay day. \nDonald Deane (15:43)\nVacay days, you know so. Medical stuff. \nKevin Fitzpatrick (15:48)\nOkay. Do you want to talk now, Kev? \nDonald Deane (15:50)\nOr do we have. Yeah, we could talk. Yeah. Okay. \nDonald Deane (15:53)\nthanks to everyone else i guess", "input": ""}

{"category": "note_summarization", "instruction": "I need a creative note summarizing the novel 'The Enchanted Forest.' Capture the essence of the plot, major character developments, and the book's underlying theme.", "input": "The Enchanted Forest\n\nChapter 1: The Discovery\n\nIn the heart of a mystical kingdom lay an ancient forest that had remained hidden from human sight for centuries. Legends whispered of its enchantment, a place where magic danced amidst the trees and creatures unknown to the outside world roamed freely. The people of the kingdom spoke of it in hushed tones, fearing what they did not understand.\n\nOne day, a young orphan named Elara, with a heart full of curiosity and a mind unburdened by the prejudices of the elders, stumbled upon a mysterious map while exploring the dusty attic of the orphanage. The map depicted a pathway leading to the fabled Enchanted Forest, dotted with magical symbols that intrigued her adventurous spirit.\n\nElara's eyes sparkled with excitement as she made up her mind to venture into the unknown. Little did she know that her destiny would intertwine with the secrets hidden deep within the forest's heart.\n\nChapter 2: Into the Unknown\n\nWith the map clutched tightly in her hands, Elara set forth on her journey to the Enchanted Forest. She travelled through dense valleys and across vast plains until, finally, the towering trees of the mystical woodland appeared before her. The air seemed to shimmer with an otherworldly glow, and every rustle of leaves carried a song of its own.\n\nAs she delved deeper into the forest, Elara encountered peculiar creatures that seemed to spring to life from the pages of a fairytale. Talking animals, luminous fireflies, and shimmering butterflies accompanied her on her path, guiding her through the magical labyrinth.\n\nChapter 3: The Guardian of Nature\n\nIn the heart of the Enchanted Forest, Elara encountered the Guardian of Nature\u2014a majestic being with antlers like those of a deer, wings like an eagle, and a shimmering mane of silver. The Guardian's eyes held ancient wisdom, and its presence emanated a soothing aura that calmed her restless heart.\n\nThe Guardian explained that the forest was a sanctuary of nature's magic, and its purpose was to protect the balance between the human world and the enchanted realm. However, the magical harmony was fading, and darkness was seeping into the forest.\n\nChapter 4: The Unseen Threat\n\nElara learned that an ancient curse had been cast upon the Enchanted Forest by a sorceress long ago, seeking vengeance for a wrong committed against her family. The curse threatened to consume the forest in eternal darkness and doom the magical creatures to a life of misery.\n\nDetermined to break the curse and save the forest, Elara embarked on a quest to find the lost relics, each holding a fragment of the enchantress's heart. Legend said that these relics could restore harmony to the forest and banish the darkness forever.\n\nChapter 5: A Journey of Friendship and Sacrifice\n\nThroughout her journey, Elara encountered both friends and foes. She formed bonds with the magical creatures, each of them offering their unique abilities to aid her quest. Along the way, she faced trials and challenges that tested her courage and resolve.\n\nAs Elara collected the lost relics, she discovered the sorceress's tragic backstory, realizing that her own destiny was deeply intertwined with the sorceress's past. With each relic recovered, she found herself drawn closer to understanding the source of the enchantress's pain.\n\nChapter 6: Breaking the Curse\n\nIn the final confrontation with the darkness, Elara found herself standing face-to-face with the specter of the sorceress, who had been bound to the Enchanted Forest by her own anger and hatred. The forest's magic began to wane, threatening to tear the mystical realm apart.\n\nSummoning all her empathy and compassion, Elara reached out to the sorceress, offering understanding and forgiveness. In a moment of profound revelation, the sorceress's anger dissolved into tears, breaking the curse that bound her to the forest. As her heart healed, so did the forest, and the light returned, illuminating the enchanting realm once more.\n\nChapter 7: A New Guardian\n\nWith the curse lifted, the Guardian of Nature bestowed upon Elara a sacred responsibility\u2014the role of the new Guardian. She would carry the wisdom and magic of the forest within her, protecting it for generations to come.\n\nElara's return to the kingdom was met with wonder and awe. She shared the stories of the Enchanted Forest, inspiring others to embrace the magic of the world around them with open hearts.\n\nAnd so, the Enchanted Forest, once a secret whispered in legends, became a beacon of light and wonder, reminding everyone of the beauty and enchantment that lies just beyond the borders of our understanding. Elara's journey of discovery turned into a timeless tale, an epic legend that would be passed down through generations\u2014a reminder that magic resides in the hearts of those who believe in the unseen wonders of the world.\n\nThe end."}
{"category": "note_summarization", "instruction": "summarize the following transcript into notes, in bullet form, include headings, all of this should be easy to understand as if the reader were a beginner, make sure to use the .md/plaintext formatting, using \"#\" as h1, \"##\" as h2 & \"###\" as h3:\n\nWelcome back.\n\nIn this lecture, we're going to review the things that we have done.\n\nWe're going to check out the last of the settings in the ad design section, and then we're just going\n\nto go ahead and publish it.\n\nSo let's start off and looking at what we've actually done and just safeguard everything to make sure\n\nthat it's all good.\n\nNow, scrolling up to the very top, we've named our ad correctly.\n\nWe have the right Facebook page.\n\nWe've added in our Instagram account, manual upload.\n\nWe've selected a single image or video.\n\nSo we add three videos or three images.\n\nMulti advertiser ads needs to be checked with added three creatives.\n\nRemember, not more, not less.\n\nWe allow to optimize.\n\nWe have added in to primary text and we've added in to headlines.\n\nNow, when it comes to the primary text and the headlines, there are a couple of rules and I'm going\n\nto link this meta rules page in the resources section as well.\n\nBut there are certain things you're allowed to do in certain things you're not allowed to do, and it's\n\nall going to be in here.\n\nFor example, it says methods Advertising policy prohibiting ads that contain personal attributes,\n\nincluding information on avoiding assumptions about someone's personal attributes in your ads.\n\nSo the question is, what on earth does that mean you're not allowed to somehow use people's attributes?\n\nWell, if you click in here and scroll down a little, you're going to get a couple of more examples.\n\nFor example, if you have an ad text, it says, Find out how our financial services can help people\n\nlike you who just turned 62.\n\nYou can see, Well, what's the problem with that?\n\nThis ad implies a knowledge of the exact age of the person who sees the ad or here example ad six meet\n\nother Jewish singles.\n\nAnd the violation is that it implies to know the individual's religion is Jewish.\n\nSo you're not allowed to assume any attributes.\n\nYou cannot target ethnicity, you cannot target people and call them out as overweight or to be underweight\n\nor to be a certain age or anything that's literally specific.\n\nNow, there's a lot of rules, and it goes on a many different topics, like I've just gone back about\n\nsensational content, cryptocurrency dating, online gaming and gambling, alcohol, social issues,\n\netc. It's easy to make a mistake, but should your ad get shut down and you are in that bad luck should\n\nyour account get banned later on in the course, there's going to be a lecture about what to do if you\n\naccidentally break some of the rules.\n\nThere's a lot of different ways to approach this and go around this.\n\nAnd the good news is it's not going to be the end of your world.\n\nYou're still going to be able to get ads up and continue running them.\n\nBut depending on if it was just an ad or if it was an account ban, there are different approaches and\n\nwe're going to talk much more about that later on.\n\nWhat to do and then how to do it.\n\nNow going back, the good news is that we've modeled other people in these primary texts and in these\n\nheadlines.\n\nSo chances are they are going to be saved because they've been up for more than six months.\n\nThey're already profitable.\n\nThey probably work.\n\nWith that said, some locations are more prone to having their ads shut down than others.\n\nSo, for example, if you're in Silicon Valley, California, there's a lot of ads coming out of there.\n\nIf you have a lot of ads shut down, then the algorithm is going to be more sensitive in that area.\n\nSimilarly, if you're spending a lot more money on ads, the algorithm is going to be less sensitive\n\nfor shutting down your ads.\n\nSo it's not fair, but it's just how it works.\n\nAnd it's worth to keep in mind, scrolling down, we're not going to touch the description.\n\nWe have the website URL and we need to click on preview your URL just to make sure that we haven't added\n\nin the wrong address, because not only is it going to shut down your ad and give you a warning, you're\n\nnot going to have any results whatsoever.\n\nSo this is completely correct.\n\nThat's great.\n\nI'm going to click this down, head back.\n\nScrolling down.\n\nWe have a display link.\n\nNow, the display link is just going to be the URL that shows here for us.\n\nIt's fine.\n\nBut if I were sending people to perhaps a course page, it might be called KAWS dot Robin and Jasper\n\ndot com, and that's not a super attractive link.\n\nSo if this was the actual URL, I might actually in the display link add in robin and Jasper dot com\n\njust like this, because then it's going to be more clear who it's from, a safer URL.\n\nIt's not going to look weird in any way, but for us it actually is from Robin and Jasper dot com so\n\nwe don't need to add in a display link, but if you have some subdomain name it might be worthwhile\n\nto do so.\n\nCall extension is only if you're going to add in an actual phone number.\n\nFor example, if you have a service that might be a great idea.\n\nIf you're running restaurant ads, you can write in your phone number and you're going to be able to\n\nget people to click on the button and call you here.\n\nBut we're not going to use that call to action is the actual button in here.\n\nAnd we don't need to make this complicated.\n\nWe don't need to test this because this isn't what drives the needle in your business, is having a\n\nwinning offer and creating winning attractive ad designs.\n\nSo it's not about the actual call to action button, but for us who are selling an online course, we're\n\ntrying to get people to watch your video in our video on our landing page.\n\nSo we're going to use learn more so that you can just approach it slowly and check it out.\n\nIf you're selling a product from your ecommerce right away, then you're probably going to want to go\n\nin here and use let's see, shop now, for example.\n\nNow if it's an app download would make a lot of sense to use, contact us if you're selling a service,\n\nespecially a high ticket service.\n\nIt's just going to depend on what you're using.\n\nBut Learn more is perfect for our purposes.\n\nAgain, you don't need to test this.\n\nDon't waste time and energy on things that in the end won't really matter.\n\nScrolling down, we have our tracking.\n\nThe most most important is going to be that the pixel is in place.\n\nPerfect offline events.\n\nNow it's going to be tracking data for offline events.\n\nWe're not going to use it, but it's automatically set up.\n\nIt always tracks.\n\nThere's one more thing and that is the URL parameters.\n\nSo if you click and build a URL parameter, you can add in some custom information here and that is\n\ngreat.\n\nIf you are a big brand and you're running Google ads and you want all of this information into your\n\nGoogle ads as well.\n\nNow, if you connect Google ads here, you're already going to get that information.\n\nBut this allows you to be more specific in your information.\n\nSo a good rule here is if you don't know what a URL parameter is and you don't know what any of this\n\nmeans, you probably don't need it.\n\nBut if you are running a bigger brand and you want more customizable and more detailed data in your\n\nGoogle Analytics, for example, or whatever third party software you're using, this can be a good\n\nidea to set up for your different ads, But we don't need to do this.\n\nWe don't need to waste time on it.\n\nSo that's it.\n\nNow we have our ad design all set up.\n\nSo what we're going to do is we're going to click on Advanced Preview, and now we can see what our\n\nads are going to look like in different places.\n\nAnd this is pretty cool, isn't it?\n\nWe have our Facebook feed is going to be right here.\n\nWe have our Instagram feed marketplace video feeds.\n\nWe have the primary text up here.\n\nWe have the headline down here.\n\nWe have the video here, the call to action button of Learn More.\n\nSo very, very cool stuff.\n\nIt's too long for Facebook stories.\n\nThat's absolutely fine.\n\nSome placements just aren't going to work.\n\nIt's going to show up in the reels, etc. But as you can see, not always, but most of the times worthwhile\n\nto create vertical videos because for example, on reels you're going to have more area here to show\n\nyour video when it's horizontal like this videos, you're not going to use all of this space and it\n\nis a good idea to use all of this space.\n\nThat is something that you can try out later on as well and test it.\n\nBut as a starting point, use vertical videos most of the time.\n\nSo this all looks amazing.\n\nI'm going to click this one down.\n\nI'm going to go down now and I'm just going to click on publish down here.\n\nAmazing.\n\nSo it's publish.\n\nI'm going to close this down.\n\nSo now if we go all the way back to campaigns, we have one campaign and within that campaign we have\n\ntwo different ad sets.\n\nWe have the winners ad sets where we're going to put all of the successful ad creatives to all the successful\n\nads.\n\nAnd we have the dynamic creative testing, which is the one we're running right now.\n\nSo if I click on winners, you can see it has no ads on it.\n\nBut if I go back and deselect it and I click on Dynamic creative Testing, you can see that it's going\n\nto have this one test in here.\n\nAnd remember, it has three creatives, two primary text and two headlines.\n\nSo that means that there are 12 different configurations because they can mix and match in many different\n\nways and Facebook can make a lot of more iterations that it wants, but at least 12 different iterations\n\nthat it can test later on.\n\nI'm going to leave this on for a couple of days.\n\nWe're going to come back and we're going to look at the statistics that we're getting from these ads\n\nand see is anything successful?\n\nIs anything working?\n\nWhich ad is performing the best?\n\nWhy is it performing the best?\n\nAnd we're going to have a breakdown of those statistics.\n\nBut for now, if you just publish with me, know that it's going to say processing here.\n\nAnd once it's up and running, it should say active.\n\nSo you're going to want to go back and make sure that this is actually on make sure that this ad set\n\nis actually on and make sure that this ad is also on, because then they're all going to be running.\n\nAnd since the winners, even though it's on, it, doesn't have any ad in it, So it won't be costing\n\nyou any money.\n\nIt can do anything.\n\nAnd then for now, this is it.\n\nIn the next lecture, we're going to be looking at a couple of statistics that's going to have come\n\nfrom running these ads.\n\nBut again, I want to say, if you're in a new account with a new pixel, you're going to have to run\n\nads for a little bit before you start getting good results.\n\nSo chances of us getting sales and becoming profitable in the beginning quite low.\n\nBut still we're going to

ROXIE (16, insightful, insecure, bald) is a typical teenage girl, except\u2026she has Alopecia. Completely hairless, Roxie wears a wig, leaving most her peers unaware of her condition. Life hasn\u2019t been so easy since she lost her hair. Her father ADAM (50) left the family to move to Montauk, leaving DEBRA (40\u2019s, marketing exec, fitness obsessed, anorexic) an emotional wreck. Fortunately, Roxie\u2019s supported by her bestie LIZZIE (16, lesbian). Roxie crushes on MIKE (17, hot) in her gym class but\u2019s terrified he\u2019ll think she\u2019s a freak. It\u2019s near the end of the school year, summer\u2019s arrived. Roxie\u2019s grandmother, LENORE (77, regal) calls Debra from Florida with unfortunate news; Larry, Debra\u2019s father and Lenore\u2019s husband of fifty years, has passed away. She\u2019ll be flying home with the body tomorrow for a weekend funeral.\n\nLenore arrives and makes funeral arrangements. She loves Roxie dearly, and pulls a softer side of the girl out from beneath her bratty teenage veneer. Roxie\u2019s beautiful when she has her wig off, stunning even. Roxie can\u2019t imagine ever showing the world her baldness. Debra\u2019s devastated to lose her father. Lenore was once a famous soap opera actress, leaving Larry to do most of the parenting when Debra was a child. Adam attends the funeral awkwardly but Lenore\u2019s glad he came. He tells Roxie he\u2019s started seriously dating someone up in Montauk, infuriating Debra. That night, Roxie goes to a beach party with Lenore and gets high with the popular kids including Mike, and Lizzie's secret girlfriend ALLISON (17). Everyone\u2019s flirty and fun but when Mike suggests they all go swimming, Roxie freaks and makes Lizzie take her home. (She can\u2019t get her wig wet)\n\nDebra\u2019s work has suffered since her separation. Her boss chews her out for laziness, tardiness, pushing Debra to work harder to improve herself. Debra tries myriad fitness activities throughout the film, and is almost always working out or planning a new diet. At her gym, she meets JEFF (50\u2019s, fit, kind) and oh do the sparks fly. Jeff works at a local Beach Club and offers to give Roxie a job for the summer. He\u2019d also give the family free access to the club. He really likes Debra. Roxie\u2019s not thrilled at first to have to work, but soon realizes Mike and his friends visit the Beach Club every day, giving her ample opportunity to woo from her post at the concession stand. She gives him free snacks, she plays his favorite band on the speakers, etc. Meanwhile, Lenore sticks around, afraid to move back to Florida and live alone. On errands about town, she\u2019s recognized by fans of her old tv show. Everyone mentions how unfair it was when they killed her character, but we don\u2019t know why. She takes Roxie to lunch one weekend at a local diner. Mike, Allison and their friend TARA (16) enter the diner and Mike\u2019s nice enough to come over and say hello/introduce himself to Lenore. Afterwards, we hear Tara gossiping with Mike. She tells him Roxie has alopecia/no hair!\n\nAt the beach club soon after, on a rainy day, Mike comes over to the concession stand to shelter from the storm. He\u2019s really flirty with Roxie, their arms touch, but when he reaches out to feel her hair, Roxie freaks and backs away. He asks point blank if she wears a wig, Roxie lies and says no. Mike backs off, Roxie\u2019s mortified. -- Debra gets closer with Jeff, but has a temper tantrum when Adam calls her to say he\u2019d like Roxie to meet his new girlfriend. Debra seethes. She reads about a popular meditation practice and drives up to Montauk to take a class. LAURA (40\u2019s, hippy) leads the class. Forgive yourself. Forgive your transgressors etc. Unfortunately, Laura is Adam\u2019s new girlfriend. She realizes this outside the studio right after her first lesson. Debra too is mortified, she flees home. \n\nThe three women get into a fight with each other back home, each projecting their frustrations onto the other. Debra blames Adam for her problems, for leaving her alone to raise Roxie, and hates that Roxie wants anything to do with him. Roxie blames Debra for never asking how she\u2019s doing/handling her hair loss. They each say things they\u2019ll regret and when Lenore tries to step in and stop the fighting, they flip out and start shoving each other/screaming. In the chaos, Roxie\u2019s wig gets knocked into a pile of spilled milk! Lenore goes to console Roxie, the two then go to the beach but Roxie doesn\u2019t take her wig! Once there, Roxie\u2019s nerves spike, but Lenore assures her she looks fantastic; they tan and talk. Lenore reveals that when Roxie was a baby, Lenore was diagnosed with breast cancer, and lost all her hair from chemo before finally having one breast removed. She wears a prosthetic to hide the missing breast. Roxie had no idea. To Roxie\u2019s surprise, Lizzie, Allison, Mike, and Tara pass them at the beach. They\u2019re shocked to find Roxie bald, but Roxie\u2019s devastated to see Mike holding hands with Tara! Lizzie knew they were dating and lied about it! Lenore takes Roxie home.\n\nRoxie ignores Lizzie\u2019s calls, and tries to sleep. Lenore and Debra have a heart to heart about their own issues. Lenore wants to be there for Debra. The next morning, Debra apologizes to the family for freaking out the night before, she\u2019s trying to work on her anger. -- Mike approaches Roxie at the concession stand a few days later and tells Roxie it\u2019s super cool she stopped wearing the wig, he thinks she looks great. Roxie\u2019s finally feeling confident.\n\nThat weekend, Roxie goes to dinner, bald, with Adam and Laura. Laura turns out to be perfectly lovely; she compliments Roxie\u2019s beauty. Lizzie surprises Roxie in the bathroom at dinner and apologizes for lying. Allison\u2019s been coming out as bi and things were just really stressful etc. Roxie forgives her. Meanwhile, Jeff asks Debra on a proper date and the two go to dinner, they kiss! Debra\u2019s boss also calls to tell her she\u2019s been doing great work. Lenore spends her evening in a grief counseling group. She finally expresses her sadness and fear of loneliness out loud. When Roxie gets home, she finds her wig and throws it away.\n\nThe next morning, the three women wake up refreshed, anew. They drive to a secret secluded beach where they can tan alone. Lenore takes off her prosthetic, Roxie\u2019s bald, and Debra confident for once. Each alive in their own skin. They drive home singing. The end.", "input": ""}

That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.\n\nPrudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\n\nSuch has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained, and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is, at this time, transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions, We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.

Highlight the speaker's personal anecdotes and the core message about overcoming adversity.", "input": "Title: The Power of Resilience\n\n[Introduction]\n\nGood afternoon, ladies and gentlemen! Thank you for joining me today to explore a topic that has shaped the course of human history and continues to do so: \"The Power of Resilience.\" Throughout time, our world has faced unprecedented challenges, from natural disasters to wars, pandemics to personal setbacks. And yet, we, as a species, have consistently demonstrated an astonishing ability to bounce back, to adapt, and to thrive in the face of adversity.\n\nToday, we will delve into the remarkable strength of the human spirit, the science of resilience, and how embracing this power can empower us to not only overcome obstacles but also to grow, innovate, and create a better future for all.\n\n[The Human Spirit: A Tale of Resilience]\n\nResilience is not just an abstract concept; it is ingrained in the very fabric of our existence. Consider the incredible stories of individuals who have triumphed over unimaginable hardships\u2014people like Malala Yousafzai, who stood up against oppression and championed girls' education, or Nelson Mandela, who endured decades of imprisonment for the sake of equality and reconciliation.\n\nFrom personal battles to collective struggles, the human spirit has shown its indomitable nature time and time again. These stories illuminate the core message of resilience\u2014our capacity to transform adversity into strength, tragedy into triumph, and challenges into opportunities.\n\n[Understanding Resilience: The Science Behind It]\n\nResilience is not merely an innate quality; it is a skill that can be cultivated and honed. Scientists and psychologists have extensively studied resilience, revealing key factors that contribute to its development.\n\nOne crucial aspect is adaptability\u2014the ability to flexibly adjust to changing circumstances. This adaptive mindset allows us to view challenges as opportunities for growth rather than insurmountable obstacles. Additionally, a strong social support system plays a vital role in bolstering resilience. By fostering meaningful connections and a sense of belonging, we can draw strength from others during difficult times.\n\nMoreover, our capacity to find meaning and purpose amidst adversity fuels our resilience. When we can attribute significance to our struggles, they become stepping stones towards personal growth and fulfillment.\n\n[Embracing Resilience: Overcoming Challenges]\n\nLife is replete with setbacks, disappointments, and unexpected hardships. Whether it's a career setback, a health crisis, or the loss of a loved one, embracing resilience becomes our compass to navigate through the storm.\n\nWhen we face adversity, it is essential to acknowledge our emotions, for resilience does not mean suppressing pain or putting on a brave face. Instead, it involves processing our emotions, seeking support, and learning to reframe our experiences positively.\n\nResilience doesn't promise a life free of suffering, but it does offer us the strength to stand tall in the face of adversity and to channel our struggles into transformative power. It enables us to adapt, to learn, and to come out stronger on the other side.\n\n[Building Resilient Communities]\n\nResilience doesn't exist solely on an individual level; it is equally crucial on a community and societal scale. Building resilient communities requires fostering a culture of compassion, empathy, and support. By acknowledging the struggles of others and offering help when needed, we can collectively create a safety net that promotes well-being and growth for all.\n\nFurthermore, investing in education, healthcare, and social programs ensures that individuals and communities have access to the resources they need to cope with and recover from adversities.\n\n[Conclusion]\n\nIn conclusion, the power of resilience is a force that can shape our lives and the world we live in. It is an essential skill that enables us to adapt, learn, and thrive amidst life's challenges. From the indomitable spirit of individuals to the collective strength of communities, resilience empowers us to rise above adversity and create a brighter future.\n\nLet us embrace resilience as a guiding light, not just in our personal journeys but also in our pursuit of a more compassionate and equitable world. By drawing from the wellspring of our inner strength and supporting one another, we can overcome any obstacle, no matter how daunting it may seem.\n\nTogether, let us harness the power of resilience and embark on a journey of transformation, innovation, and hope for a better tomorrow. Thank you.\n\n[Applause]"}

{"category": "note_summarization", "instruction": "\"Organize this transcript into a detailed status report; listing all people on the call, any topics discussed and sub bullets of action items raised, thoughts, comments, concerns and opportunities moving forward.\"\nThis report should be a resource for anyone to read and understand what the key points were.\n \nShirin Safavy\n00:34\nso as far as our agenda for today i'll walk us through\nour goals and objectives. From this past year\ni'll cover an executive summary our accomplishments together.\nand then we'll talk through campaign performance.\nand Sandy will take over from there and walk through some insights and learnings, and\nwe'll wrap up with opportunities and next steps.\nSo our biggest goal for 2022 was to create awareness of the Qsp Partner program\nspecifically talking to the Isv.\nAnd Msp audiences, which was something that has not been done before\n \nShirin Safavy\n01:51\nSo our end goal\nfor this year was to increase partner sales of the cute\nquickbook solutions.\nwe also wanted to create some educational opportunities for partners so that they could more effectively market and sell these solutions, especially the quick books online solution.\nAnd i'm not gonna read through everything. There's a lot to talk through today. So if there's something you see on here that we didn't cover\nfeel free to ask about that\nlater in the meeting.\nSo in 2,022, we provided over 5,700 new leads we did this by developing and launching lead Gen. Programs for partner recruitment\nand through partner marketing\nwe managed a total of 16 webinars, including the execution\nwhich freed up a lot of time for Gina and her team.\nWe hosted and developed marketing best practices content, and we did this\nfor 7 monthly meet the expert series.\nand we also refined the Isv. And msp messaging, so that we can better address the needs of those audiences.\nSo what did we accomplish?\nI just mentioned that we generated over 5,700 leads.\nhere's how they break down. So 3 300 of those were generated for Isv.\nMs. P. For the partner recruitment.\nand a little over 2,400 leads were through Webinar registrations\nand Content Syndication programs.\nWe also created a newsletter in Mailchim. This was for leads that had completed the nurture, but didn't convert\nand traffic on the on 24 site pages were significantly increased so previously. They were a little under 200\nper week.\nand they have increased to over a 1,000 per week.\nAs far as nurture campaigns. We developed 2 separate tracks with 5 touches each one for ISP and one for Msp.\nThese were sent out on a weekly cadence, and began in April of 2,022\nas you can see below. Under the offer column we used a variety of assets.\nUnfortunately, we'd already use the existing ebook for Content Syndication, so we used a mix of blogs, case studies and\npapers\nfor these 5 touches.\nHere on the right, we have a couple of samples of these emails. One for is one for Msp.\nThe metrics for the ISP\nnurture track were to get significantly higher.\nYou can see the numbers here are well above industry standard averages, and as far as the Msp. Audience goes\nthese rates. They're not bad. They're just closer to the standards of the industry.\n \nSandi Settle\n05:18\nYeah, I think there's an opportunity here for us to work on the messaging for the Msps. That's one thing to point out to to kind of dial that in a little bit better.\n \nHoward Sewell\n05:26\nExactly. I I will stress, if I may just jump in. I you know, I think of industry standards, for a houseless like this is sort of, you know, 10 to 15% somewhere in there as being kind of, you know, a to good.\nSo 20% is nothing to be ashamed of or the click rate for that matter. But we've set ourselves a high bar, which is which is great, and and there's always room for for testing and optimization.\n \nAnila Baseel\n05:53\nI think these are great numbers. because the average industry rate for the open rate, it's not 20% right. It's probably less than that.\n \nHoward Sewell\n06:01\nYeah, definitely.\nYep. Exactly.\n \nGina Madson\n06:04\nYeah. And we're excited as we go into this next year we're going to have a lot more content. Both success stories and testimonials. So I think I hope that new, fresh, engaging content, especially a lot of video content will also play into better click through rates and the nurtures as well.\n \nAnila Baseel\n06:24\nAnd you know, I would add this because we probably need to start thinking about franchise, too.\non that.\nYeah, it's a big opportunity here. So we should talk about that for sure.\n \nGina Madson\n06:37\nOkay.\n \nSandi Settle\n06:40\nwe're here to help Gina.\n \nShirin Safavy\n06:46\nSo another accomplishment where the office hours webinars these consisted of spear speakers.\nUnfortunately, we don't have data for the earlier sessions. But we have really good data for the past 3 months, and we'll continue\nto have that in the future. So we can compare each session to the last.\n \nSandi Settle\n07:07\nYeah. Our hope is also to do some serving of your partners to see what they want to learn more about, and the type of content that they're interested in. But we'll build out a series for next year.\nWith that information, I think we're slated for February for our first one\n \nUnknown Speaker\n07:25\nfor 2,023.\n \nShirin Safavy\n07:26\nYes, that's correct.\nAnd here are some samples of the partner creatives These are the emails we sent through our third party partner\nand promoted through content. Syndication.\nyou can see at the top we use dual logos. So the quick books logo is always at the top right, and the partner Logo is on the left.\nWe strategically chose images that fit each industry. And you can see below in these samples we played around with the buttons to determine\nwhere\nthe best performance is. based on button placement, and determine that\nthe 2 green ones top placement performs best.\n \nAnila Baseel\n08:11\nand do we have numbers on how the messaging may have done like between. Notify Mendelssohn and margin Edge, like what resonated better with the audience.\n \nSandi Settle\n08:23\nWell, their audiences are a bit different because they're different industries. For the most part we can go back and analyze and take a look at them.\n \nAnila Baseel\n08:32\nI know we did a series. We did more for some of the partners than others, so we don't have as much to kind of compare to, but we can look at that, because we have the data and the performance, and each of them I'm asking is like, I see one of them is Nsp. Mandelson. The rest are. Is these\nWhat the feedback we got from is this was that they're looking more for us to do a\ncustomization approach in terms of messaging.\nThey have their own solution integrated to quick books. We have our own. So how do we make that peanut butter, jelly, sandwich kind of thing approach right with is. so i'm just wondering if one of them resonated better where we have more of a connected messaging.\n \nSandi Settle\n09:18\nOkay.\nwe'll take a look at that.\n \nGina Madson\n09:22\nYeah, I know for notify and margin edge we provide spear with the co-value proposition\n \nAnila Baseel\n09:28\ncontent and messaging. So yeah, it'd be curious to see if we do better with those that you guys did. we are working towards that Co. Marketing messaging. Okay?\n \nSandi Settle\n09:44\nWell, I think you'll see some of that. a little Further, we have a surprise to show you.\n \nShirin Safavy\n09:54\nOkay, and moving on to the part Prospect Partner Newsletter. So\nthe data below is for the first issue, which went out pretty recently on November first.\nclicks look good click to open rates look pretty great.\nSo\n \nSandi Settle\n10:12\nthe one thing we learned from this is we obviously need more content. So some of this is is also reaching out or utilizing some industry content as well. For educational purposes that we think you know they would be interested in, but we'd love more.\nI\ninto it related content.\nfor these newsletters moving forward.\n \nAnila Baseel\n10:36\nSorry I, my mindful, but I mentioned here. I think this for recruit. Probably.\nso. I almost feel like in the title is grabbing their attention because quick books is a big name. That's the o open rate that shows is.\n \nSandi Settle\n10:54\nand the CTO. Specifically, which is great\n \nAnila Baseel\n10:58\nWonder if we can align. And this is our problem. If we can align those leads to how we closed internally, or I'll be the right ones.\n \nGina Madson\n11:10\nSo this is the the Newsletter that we just started sending monthly Anila, and it's going to the long term nurture. So the leads that have already gone through sales and haven't converted yet so that this kind of like our drip continuing to message to them.\nso we've only yeah. I had the last month, really. And then the second one went out the beginning of December. But that's for sure something we're trying to track internally, and you know, like pass over. If someone re-engages\nand starts to raise our hand at the bottom of every Newsletter. It's a call to action to, you know, book time with LED basically so we're trying to promote that with these.\n \nAnila Baseel\n11:50\nSo, Gina, we don't know how many we got through meetings with LED\n \nGina Madson\n11:54\nas of this one. I don't believe any have been booked with end from the Newsletter right now, because they're overly a newsletter, and they're like, Wait, this is this is nothing. So we\nagain, if if it was all a 100% Qsp. Content, and they may not feel relevant either. So we need to\nchange up the mix of content. We had, you know, more industry, available news and\ncontent available. So that's kind of what we use, but\nthat isn't the plan long term.\n \nSandi Settle\n12:26\nRight?\n \nUnknown Speaker\n12:32\nOkay?\n \nShirin Safavy\n12:34\nOkay. So this chart on the right shows engagement time on the\npartner sites between February and October of this year.\nYou can see the time on the site is pretty low. It's not where we want to be. We want to increase engagement to keep people coming back.\nSo that is definitely something. We'll continue to work on\n \nSandi Settle\n12:59\nOne thing to call out there to the time on site\nwill help with refreshing, you know. As we get more content they'll have more reason to come back more frequently to, you know, spend time on site. They\nright now we're using the site more to come for one purpose like to register for something, and then they pop off. What we want to do is is, keep them there. Keep them looking, going deeper into the site, and so forth. So\nwe have talked to Gina about, you know, building out. Maybe some industry pages and things like that. what we can do as far as promotion of that site is limited because it's on on 24\nSomething to think about in the future is potentially building it like a micro site or something that we could actually do some social promotion to\nwe're limited in that now, but content is a big factor in keeping them there\n \nGina Madson\n13:54\nright. This is our on 24 hub, so it's not a main website. but it's where our lower content and our Webinar registrations are housed. So\nnot\nexactly a main partner website, but that is something that's in the works for\nfor next year. What I was also thinking right for future discussion is.\n \nAnila Baseel\n14:15\nwe have this. We're also internally working on our quickbooks.com site\nto add partner specific page, and we have to drive that page also. So when you talk about a micro site\nthat could be a gateway coming into our quick books. Right? so we can drive traffic one. Another driver would be our directory. So we're hoping to get that more robust, and that's going to be our partners outward facing to customers.\nOkay. So how do we help them generate on the for marketing piece there? Also?\n \nUnknown Speaker\n14:58\nOkay.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:01\nSorry. Taking notes.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:05\nI think it is important to note just looking at this chart here that visitors have been increasing.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:11\nSo, we're headed in the right direction.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:14\nAnd\nnow that we're seeing momentum with visitors, we just want to keep them there longer and keep them coming back.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:23\nExactly.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:28\nOh, now it's happening again.\n \nSandi Settle\n15:30\nI\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:31\nThere we go.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n15:37\nOkay.\n \nShirin Safavy\n15:38\nSo campaign. Sorry, guys.\nit's like it knows everybody is on this. Call it doesn't want to cooperate.\nSo looking at the nurture campaign results, As I mentioned earlier, we had 2 separate tracks, 5 touches each.\nYou can see we're pretty close to industry averages. Those are listed at the very bottom of this chart.\nSome touches performed better than others. we've recently been working on rewriting some of this copy, so we do look forward to seeing how they'll measure in the next few months. Compared\nto these measurements.\nand the Msp. Track actually performed much better than is V. Which makes sense. When you think about it, because most of the assets we used, or\nvery closely related to Msp.\nfor example, this third touch here performed really well.\nSo.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n16:42\nhmm.\n \nShirin Safavy\n16:44\nAnother thing I wanted to point out is that in the beginning of our engagement we were sending these emails manually. So Spear was manually going into mailchimp and sending the touches out each week.\nand as we added to the series, and had a complete set of 5, we were able to recreate the nurture within mailch as an automated series.\nSo and gina i'm sure you remember that.\nSo I want to be sure that you know these numbers are based on the automated series, not the manual.\n \nGina Madson\n17:14\nOkay.\n \nShirin Safavy\n17:19\nAnd this is a summary slide of the partner Webinar programs for post-event promotion.\nThese partners receive content syndication leads after their webinar.\nAnd the reason there's no costs per lead for the first one for margin edge is because we used and make good for that project\n \nAnila Baseel\n17:42\nfor these numbers.\nI I guess I need to understand what the definition of lead is. is it just? if it is just attendees. Then let's call it out. 1 50 attendees right? Because when we'd say, when we talk about these numbers to sales, they like leads\noh, leads. They consider as qualified. So, unless we have a qualification, we should probably say attendees. The other thing is from for my team. I think we we're at a point, Gina, where we could look at these coming in. And if we, how can we\ncontinue the journey of where these are from the partner, and that's going to be a tough one.\n \nGina Madson\n18:24\nYeah. So with these ones we have report the attendees and the registrants separately. And then this was actually after the fact. After the Webinar. We syndicated it as a piece that someone could go out and register for and targeted that syndication through spears, various\nagencies right to those targeted audiences. So these leads are people that clicked on it and said, oh, I want to watch that Webinar i'm, you know, going to register. So then we pass them over to the Qsp. And they fit the audience criteria that you're looking for. Specifically.\n \nSandi Settle\n19:00\nSo\nit it's kinda in between. They've raised their hand. They're interested, and they fit the right profile as\nas a lead.\n \nGina Madson\n19:08\nright? And so the feedback we've gotten from hinge and margin edge so where I Haven't heard definitively from asterisk. But that is, these are really good quality, and that they are the contacts that they want at the companies that they want to be talking to\nbut it's been mixed as they're reaching out to them, and that that lead is like\nvery familiar with it, and understand who they are and why they're reaching out to. Okay, yeah.\nI just clicked on that. It does sound interesting to me. But why are you calling me right. So like it is definitely a top of funnel lead. But it's getting them like I said, the right people at the right companies to fill that top of funnel. Then it's up to the partner to really nurture them.\n \nAnila Baseel\n19:50\nYeah, i'm wondering if we could do anything with and lift all this and and lift it a partner that we have\nwhere you know they're looking at data and a lot of vertical specific stuff. And so, even just to understand like for margin edge, or if we bucket them into verticals, so hinge full margin edge if they do a concer i'm just making this up. I don't know construction, or you know a\ninventory management solution. What are the profiles that we're looking at? Because there's going to be a lot of partners. I see specifically that are playing in the same vertical. And so how do we segment each of their specialty into that? So that's something that we could, you know, do but i'm just mentioning to.\nGina Lexi and Louise is\nif there's an if if we can create a almost like a propensity model on for each of the verticals.\n \nHoward Sewell\n20:49\nquick question. Actually, we're going to touch upon\npropensity a little later on in the in the deck quick. This question almost for for both teams. But i'm wondering in light of Gina's comment about the mixed response to outreach. Can we help provide guidance, or maybe sample scripts, or anything to these partners, one\nfor their outreach, because we hear that a lot with content syndication programs occasionally, whether the clients where leads get thrown over the fence to sales. Sales thinks they are following up on people that have expressed interest in the product. Basically\nAnd there is so. So there is sort of like a disconnect when you know. So i'm just wondering if that's something that we can\nmaybe help\nguide in a\nin a gentle way, and improve that.\nImprove that response for sure, open to it. I mean, we are pretty\n \nGina Madson\n21:40\nclear with the marketer at the queue at the partner right? That like that's what happened. This is what happened, but i'm not there controlling how they're passing into sales, and I don't know right. I think march and edge is an exception. but for him to go I know that they don't have refined\nnurture process right and different levels of sales who would be reaching out at different times. So for sure, it's something that we can do better and enable our usps with better.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n22:13\nOkay.\n \nHoward Sewell\n22:15\ncool.\n \nSandi Settle\n22:16\nYeah, I think we'll touch on it a little further down to, as you know, some of the challenges with understanding, you know. Measurement on the back end of how they, how they're doing, and how they're, you know, moving through the funnel.\ncertainly would love to be more involved in, you know. Get more transparent feedback from them, so that we can put that into our campaigns and follow up\nyour screen.\n \nShirin Safavy\n22:45\nGreat. So I will hand things over to Sandy.\n \nSandi Settle\n22:48\nAll right next slide, please.\nSo we asked Gina upfront here. if she could do a swat analysis of our relationship.\nso that we could, you know, ensure we're giving the best service possible. You know. What do we do? Well, what can we improve? I won't. Go through and read all of this, but I wanted it as part of the deck, because it is something that we're working. You know.\nWe're keeping front of mine and working on some of the things that you mentioned, where you know we do really well at the kind of lead, generation side on content, syndication and campaign execution, working on the webinars content.\nplanning and strategy. and then I I do think our relationship between our team is is strong that communication is great.\nSome areas that we can improve our, you know, on timelines. we're actively looking at ways that we can.\nyou know, keep that. Keep the projects moving quickly, making sure that we're hitting those timelines, and we, you know we added more resources onto the account as well, and Lynn and her team have been working harder on, you know.\nrefining the the messaging and trying to get those. You know the audience messaging just right. So we're gonna continuously work on that\nand we're looking at different vendors to also to see how we can refine the audience a little bit better for you as well, and finding new ways to reach. You know your target Audience.\nnext slide, please.\n \nAnila Baseel\n24:26\nSo I just on that.\nI know Gina and I talk quite a bit and thank you for sharing the learning on the content piece. Right? I mean, I know that, you guys you've tried and stuff. But honestly, we have agencies that we work with very in a, you know, deeper workshop place, and they've been on board, and they really integrated so\nhonestly from that point of view, we could get to some of the content that we've already created. And one thing that we have put in place is Harry on our team is doing the overall messaging, and we just tap into those, you know messages, right? So we're. We are putting things in place that are better because we understand that there's different places where we are going to use that content from. So you know, there's there's improvements happening on our site as well.\n \nSandi Settle\n25:14\nOh, absolutely. We know that there there are things in place. I know some things have been stuck in legal, and there have been some challenges with people being gone, and you know, nothing moves as quickly as as we would like them to, but we definitely have probably hit\nthe end of the content that we have now. So we're eagerly awaiting, you know, new assets moving forward. But if there's ever a need to do that, and we hope to be doing that more with some of the partners themselves with the marketplace program.\nThat, you know. That would be wonderful, too, is to be able to show up to share some of that.\nwe also looked at some of the opportunities and threats just to get some feedback on the industry itself. and you know, if there's any gaps in our service, or where we could help more. and so we were listening on here. We realized that you know most of the social has moved over to corporate.\nBut if there's anything that we can do from the standpoint of creating content or posts, or anything to you know. Move that along faster. Obviously we're here for you.\nLet's see here.\nwe're doing our best to get the most out of your budget to drive new leads for the Qs themselves, and also for the partner Acquisition.\nI think here we all see that the industry is slowing slightly. and budgets are, you know.\nbeing held closely.\nbut I still think that we've seen a lot of successes, and we're able to apply that kind of moving forward to get more and more efficient at helping those partners, you know, find better ways to reach their audiences and target those messages more clearly.\nNext slide, please.\nSo overall what we think went well was the communication between our teams. You know we've had really open honest discussions, but things don't work, and when they do Gina has been great at sharing everything that she sees on her side that help, you know. Help us all do better.\nwe've had the ability to test different approaches and pivot. You know quickly when things aren't working.\nwe have some resources in place that help us, you know. Get better organized and communicate better. I think we review things very quickly. The teams got open flow of communication between the channels and the\nthe regular meetings as well. we have some flexibility and adding\nadditional resources on the sphere side when there's upticks in work. So we've brought more people onto the team, and we I think we have a solid team in place.\nNext slide, please.\nSome of the challenges we, you know we had a hard time with that live Webinar\nevent promotion upfront. We learned from that, and I think we've been able to do a lot better.\nReplacing that offer with the on demand recordings and doing the promotions on the back end. also increasing kind of the mix of content that we have to work with so ebooks and case studies and things like that. when possible. Ebooks, obviously are, are one of the\nthe pieces most in demand.\nyou we discussed the partner commitment needed to kind of complete the post event. Follow up, and maybe this is an opportunity for us to help help you help them by creating some.\nmaybe best practices, as Ha! Hey? Howard had mentioned on scripts, and, you know, follow up emails to kind of level out the playing field for those partners that may not have the resources to do that.\nWe recommended kind of the creation of some\ntop of funnel ebook assets that incorporate things like case studies or snippets and testimonials. But that has a little bit more of a thought leadership. Focus. Those do much better in the ads than you know, sending them to just landing pages to go kind of look for content themselves.\nOur lack of ebook and white paper assets kind of made some of the lead generation efforts to little challenging for contents, education and and paid media advertising.\nSo we we, as I said before, we could use a little bit more of a mix of assets to kind of freshen those nurtures, and continue with the monthly newsletters. populating those. So there's no big surprises there\nmessaging.\nyou know we did find that we need some differentiation on the messaging between the audiences. They were a little too similar, I think, as you said we're working on it. It's been getting better and better.\nthe Intuit team has provided us more information, any background such as you know, surveys or any feedback that you got from your events last week, that potentially we can kind of incorporate that into the messaging\nto make it a little bit. You know more refined\nreporting as an area that we still are having some challenges, I would say, in in measuring how we're doing from a revenue, perspective and opportunities to a generated from the programs that we're doing so potentially getting salesforce access or\nregular reporting from that could help also getting some reporting from the partners themselves\nwould be beneficial.\nthe on 24 landing pages are acceptable, but\nthe fact that there's only kind of one version of the form makes some of the lead generation that we want to do.\nyou know, unattainable we recommend, maybe designing and building additional landing pages with new forms and mailchimp potentially in that in the future\nthat will help with the lead Gen. Needs, and enable us to kind of measure more\nthat lack of engagement tracking and the results from meet the experts. As we go forward, so we can kind of see how we're doing on those that would be helpful as well.\nand let's see mailchimp, you know. Mail 10 third. There are some\nareas there where we can't quite build some of the templates that we want to Some of the modules just had to be kind of tweaked to translate\nvisually in mailchimp\nbut we were able to kind of overcome that with the newsletter\nareas of opportunity the content development is is one of those areas where\nwe could use a little mix of content for the industry pages potentially creating content that's specific to those different industries. So whether it's construction or inventory management.\nmaybe creating some more content that's specific to those industries. the potential to maybe survey or interview partners to to find topics of interest, or, you know, get some some expertise on messaging from them\nidentifying cop topics of interest from your conference. I know we haven't had a chance to talk about how it went last week, but we look forward to hearing a little bit about that\nthe creation of the partner. Videos case studies and blogs that you're talking about will be exciting. for the New Year.\npotentially refreshing. That messaging based on, you know, audience surveys or interviews. is a a potential area of opportunity, and also to extend that nurture.\nconsider, maybe adding the event in a box to the menu of services for the partners for the the partner marketplace.\nwhere, since\nmany of the partners are getting back into doing live events, maybe that's an in the area of opportunity where we can package that, like we talked about earlier in the year into a program.\nand then building a monthly program for tracking on the activities that we're doing for the partners. So maybe there's a way to incentivize the partners, maybe to send back revenue or opportunity results from those Content syndication programs and other things.\nso that we can kind of get some more 2 way feedback.\nAny questions there?\n \nUnknown Speaker\n34:08\nOkay.\n \nGina Madson\n34:09\nNot a good question. But just I think on it\ncomment for the Content development. I mean any of this is something we had talked about at different points, but as we get more Qsps and have more verticalized focused content for recruiting or finding customers, I should say, for our Qsps\nwith on 24, if we had a deeper set of content right. We could have some more of those always on kind of\n \nUnknown Speaker\n34:36\ngo ahead.\n \nGina Madson\n34:37\nGoogle as as well as complementary content syndication campaigns going that are for the vertical. So then we're getting and passing weeds for partners, right? Which I know we're not yet at from a corporate standpoint, but that's kind of an option to explore down the road.\n \nAnila Baseel\n34:55\nYeah, I actually made a note sending on and you, Haven't here is.\ncan we maybe do a a focus group with the partners right? Specifically? one. A focus group for is one for Msps and really understand. Look, this is what we've delivered so far. What?\nWhat is all the things that you\nmay use right.\nThey've been doing business before even they became our partner\nfor a long time. They know how to get leads and how we land those. So if we were to leverage that information and their expertise. How do we enable them? Maybe they might be something that you know, because we're all there with some marketers, and\nyou get into our little bubble of like, hey marketing, should we do this? But sometimes when you hear things from sales, it's a light bulb going off. Oh, wait! We could have tweaked it this way, so it'd be great, because we have a lot of activities under the belt. And so how do we create the next, you know, level of\nenablement for the partners. If that's focus group that they'll be open to and trust me. Our qs are pretty open, and their voice their opinion. It'd be great to have those, you know. Call it the suggestion. I know you already have that on your board.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n36:09\nRight?\n \nSandi Settle\n36:10\nYeah, I think that would be wonderful.\nThe more information they have, the more you know more we can refine.\nand with that said, we do have an in one idea that Howard is going to talk about with an an additional partner that we work with.\nNext slide. Please\n \nHoward Sewell\n36:29\ncut my cue. That's your cue\nI got. I got given a couple of slides, so i'd feel useful. which is very nice. yeah, i'll go through this quickly, but you know, full disclosure. Rev. Is a a very new partner relationship for us. In fact, it's, you know we Haven't even really formalized\nthe relationship. But they're a really interesting company, and one that we on the spear side.\nI think that we could leverage across a pretty broad swath of client engagements, and we're in a mode right now in the early stages where we've done a couple of little tests with a couple of clients, and we're looking to do a few more. 3.\nTo gauge how clients could leverage the the data that comes out of these tests, which i'll explain so Rev. Is a. A company. Basically it's a AI-based technology, and they build a\na model of your Icp ideal customer profile based on a list of your best customers. So you give them a list of 20 customers, and say, these are: If we had another 500 of these, that would be, that would be great, and they feed that into their model and output.\na couple of things. One is other companies that look like those same customers.\nAnd secondly, what are the common characteristics that define those companies beyond the usual pharmographic. So\ngeography, company, size, industry, etc., but also what Rev. Calls hexagraphics, which is basically information on how companies execute. So\nare they an early adopter or a late adopter? Are they focused on customer service, that sort of thing, and they also they build that model based on the list the company provides. They run it against a database of 6 million dollars, 6 million companies.\nThey identify those key characteristics, and then they also come back to us with. Here are other companies that look like\nthe companies you're telling us\nare\nyour best customers.\nIf you can go to the next slide.\nShreen. Thank you.\nso this has been. we've done this a couple of times now. In fact, we're presenting our second to another client this later this week, but it has the potential to be a useful tool, we believe, on a couple of fronts one\nit could identify other, but other Isvs and Msps that are out there that are most similar to the partners that you want best to capture and bring into the program. It may identify\nspecific.\nhigh potential segment. So we may. It may be a way to identify\nthat we didn't realise it, but the partners who sell to this type of company, or that have the certain characteristic end up being our top performing partners. And if we learn more about\nwhat makes those\npartners your best\npartners, it could help inform things like messaging and content, and and that sort of thing. So our offer to you, he says, is to is to take a list of your top partners, and literally all we need is like 20 company names in their urls.\nWe'll hand it over to Rev. They'll provide us, and there's no charge for this.\nThe 2 outputs that I mentioned. They'll give us a list of these hexagraphics that are common to those companies. The one important note. There is, the larger the companies\nthe better the insights. And we've learned this the hard way, so you know, and then it has a lot to do with web presence. So the the larger the web presence the company has, the more information Rev. Can capture, so it preferably be\npartners on the upper tiers of where you guys kind of operate, and they'll also provide us\na sample list of lookalike companies from their database.\nAnd then, if we found the data compelling, and this is completely without obligation. We could then look at.\nmaybe acquiring data from Rev. They also have a lead generation platform which operates in a similar sort of content syndication\nmodel where you go to them and say, hey, i'll a\nX amount per lead, if you can find me. Other companies that look like these partners. So again the ask is.\ngive us a list of 20 companies. We'll come back to you with some data.\nno charge for doing so. The the ask in in from our side is, Tell us what you think\nis this: is this interesting? Is this useful? Could you use it?\nIs it compelling, is it? It doesn't really tell us anything we didn't already know?\nbut it's an exercise we'd love to.\nWe'd love to run.\nand I think that's it.\n \nAnila Baseel\n41:31\nHoward. Thank you for for reviewing this with us, and the answer to your questions is all the above.\nHowever, we do have already a vendor that we work with, and we we're working with the the vendor from a sales perspective, too, because they're connected there, so that you know the partners and lift. And we we do do all of these things that you're you're mentioning with them.\n \nHoward Sewell\n41:59\nSo okay\n \nAnila Baseel\n42:00\nappreciate the opportunity.\n \nHoward Sewell\n42:02\nYeah, absolutely. And I confess it again. It's a relatively new relationship\nfor us. We were excited about it because\nit allows us to kind of\nbring some technology to bear help. Refine the kind of work that we do. Everything that Sandy and Sri have been talking about content development email creative, you know targeting, etc. So we wanted to make it available to you. If frankly, if you want to do it, even as just a point of comparison.\nyou know, next to what you're getting from the other company. That is absolutely fine, but it's entirely your your.\nyour your option.\nSo\n \nAnila Baseel\n42:39\nthank you.\n \nHoward Sewell\n42:40\nYou're welcome\n \nSandi Settle\n42:42\nnext slide, please.\nSo we put together a quick action plan. Some ideas, maybe, for next steps for you and the team to take a look at and\nlet us know. You know you want us to move forward with this, but we're move we're in the development process. Sorry i'm a little tongue tied. we're in the development process for that with the cin 7 evoke\nso potentially it's As soon as that's completed we could write some blog articles on it to show how those like integrated solutions\nhelp, you know SMS and use that in the Newsletter in the resource center.\nwe could continue to work on some new industry specific topics to fill in the gaps in the resource center in the newsletter as well.\nAnother idea is to create a short script video script for that ebook as well to use in prom promotions\nto move forward with the survey questions for partners. And maybe in this case, if we don't do the survey, we could do a workshop where we could get more, you know in depth understanding\nof partner needs, but that\nthe idea here was to get ideas on their interests and topics for the office hours, webinars, but also new content pieces.\nAnalyze those survey results and suggest and some new topics for Webinars moving forward. So these are sort of like quick hits that we've identified.\nIs there anything there that you would like to add to, or anything like?\n \nAnila Baseel\n44:30\nJust a questions being that you can talk in a minute to get ready for the other for the next meeting.\nSo for the top of the funnel, content. These should be in the mark, the marketing service catalog, because initially, we had. We had helped the partners. Now we're saying, we need to Co. Invest. So\nif we don't have the video, and I'm. I'm forgetting, Louise. If we don't have the video or the blog article, or whatever from Sphere and Msc. Then we should probably add these, and that needs to be funneled through the marketing service catalogue.\n \nSandi Settle\n45:07\nGotcha. Yeah, okay.\nOn the next slide we wanted to show you. I believe it's the next slide. we wanted to show you\nsomething that we created using some of the initial data from the send 7 ebook process. We're still working on the ebook itself. But this is one example of what we can do with some of those data insights, and creating other pieces of contents that could extend the life of the campaigns, and this here is a infographic we'll provide the link to the sample right now. since Ivan has not seen this yet, either. So it's hot off the press. But this is\none exciting idea one way to visualize some of that data\nthat\nthat they provided as well.\nso our thought was to potentially, you know, turn this into a video or something as well. If the the client is interested, the prospect I have to jump off. But just 2 things. For example, one is, and we don't have to answer it on this call. One is that\n \nAnila Baseel\n46:15\nwe're trying to be out there in technology software? so how do we compete? And what are we not doing today that we could potentially look into right\nas next step for F 23. And the other is that I know Gina is amazing, and the teams really great. And you guys have been working amazingly. what else do you need from us? For me? From Gina, or anything that would make your lives a little bit easier other than content? what you know how. How else can we help you?\nbe more successful?\n \nSandi Settle\n46:48\nI think, understanding a little bit more about your overall goals for your you know your program itself and your slice of the business, I think, and understanding what you're trying to achieve for next year will help us.\nYou do do better.\ndo you have anything to add in here, Howard.\nunderstanding a little bit more about your lifetime goals, and how we measure success, you know, moving forward.\n \nHoward Sewell\n47:18\nYeah, I mean, it's always great to understand the larger goals and the grander objectives I would defer to you, Sandy, and the team being closer to the day to day than I am. But again it's it's a great\nrelationship, and one that is very collaborative, and a lot of information flowing back and forth. So\nyou know we are at this point. We are.\nyou know, and proving on\nthings that are\ngenerally working pretty well. So but we'll, you know we'll, we'll take that, you know. We'll take that request away and come back with ideas as well, so that's fair.\n \nGarrett Lawrence\n47:59\nGarrett. Did you have a question? No, i'm just gonna say, I mean, I agree anything as we learn about the specifics behind your goals and objectives that's really helpful, you know, if there's additional needs in terms of thought, leadership, and building your stature. If there's anything in customer, partner, advocacy you have, there's different things that we can contribute to. So happy to explore that and come back to you with some some thoughts.\n \nSandi Settle\n48:22\nThat's great. Thank you guys. I have to jump off, and this is really awesome. Thank you so much.\nGina Lexi. Do you have any questions?\n \nGina Madson\n48:34\nNo, i'm excited to see the ebook and the infographic, for some of them looks great, too, so that'll be great to have is the first one, and it sounds like march and edges back on track to move forward with theirs, too. So 2 of those up there to test in separate markets very different audiences. So right?\n \nSandi Settle\n48:52\nOkay, I think I have a last slide. Sorry, and this is just next steps.\nIf you could\nadvances side one more for me.\nI think next steps. Obviously, you know. Consider what's in here. We'll send you the Dac so we could develop a project plan, you know, moving forward. Some of the things we want to do is test some new vendors for the app marketplace campaign. we'd like to get approval\nan an understanding of what we're going to be moving forward with. We have a I think a straw man as to what kind of what our next\nquarter looks like, but maybe developing in the that plan out for Q. 4 2023, the April to June timeframe.\nwe will expedite the completion or we would like to expedite the completion of the ebook asset that your team is working on for content syndication.\nand we will share the infographic internally. And we're\nworking on the last touches for the ebook for cin 7 as well, and then potentially launching that partner survey or doing a workshop, whichever is best there. And if you discuss internally that you want to, you know, try out the Rev.\n \nHoward Sewell\n50:16\nOffer the insight, and i'm going to take an action item there, if I may, and that's too, because frankly, I don't know the answer to this is what makes them different, if at all, from in left.\nBecause I i'd i'd want to make sure that there's you know the differentiation and a value. Add there that would make even that exercise worthwhile. And so why Don't? Why, don't I find that out first, and then Gene and team we can. We can get back to you as to whether we still think that's maybe worth\nconsidering. So\n \nGina Madson\n50:52\nyeah, that'd be great. I'm curious to know myself. I'm sure there are some variations there, and\nI think a test would be fascinating. We just we've pulled back a little bit from our recruitment focus to emphasize more of our with partner marketing and activity. So I think that's maybe where there's a little hesitation to immediately jump in and test it. But yeah, and and again, just to be clear, I mean, this is just you know\n \nHoward Sewell\n51:17\nus running and running your customer list through their database, coming back with a few slides, and that's as far as it\nneeds to go. So it's basically just it's free data. But again, to the extent that you maybe are already getting all those insights.\nI just want to make sure it's worth even that amount of time, and that'll be on us to find out, and we'll get back to you.\n \nGina Madson\n51:37\nYeah, I mean, we do have a within. Let's not just quickly say, but we are still struggling to target effectively. We want to recruit into our program. So if there could be deeper levels of insight or takeaways or insight, you know, period information is generally helpful. So\n \nHoward Sewell\n51:55\nI I would love to test it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's great. Well, let me. Let me find out what the differences are, and then we can. We can. We can well work with Sandy and team, and we can talk about what the next steps might be.\n \nUnknown Speaker\n52:08\nSounds good.\n \nSandi Settle\n52:10\nWell, thanks, everybody, for the time we'll see you in a few minutes. I'm gonna take a quick break, and then we'll jump on the other. The other call.\n \nLynn Dodds\n52:18\nI don't think I am.\n \n Save & SubmitCancel", "input": ""}

Ads will be served to Microsoft Store users on Windows 10 and Windows 11 and are only available to developers who have already published their apps to the store.\n\nThese kinds of ads are usually described in benign terms\u2014that they're merely a way for the developers on the Microsoft Store to boost their work and find more users. The reality is that similar ads on Apple's platforms, at least in my experience, tend to be either irrelevant (ads for Twitter or Truth Social on a search for Mastodon clients), annoying (ads for shovelware free-to-play games), actively malicious (the brief period where gambling ads took over the store), or some combination of all three.\n\nThe new addition may or may not turn up relevant search results for users, but it does add more advertisements to a platform that already has plenty of them. A fresh Windows 11 install from a USB stick automatically pulls down a range of third-party apps from the Microsoft Store the first time you connect to the Internet, and Windows includes plenty of Microsoft house ads for Edge, Bing, Microsoft Start, Microsoft 365, OneDrive, and other products and features.\nMicrosoft's landing page for the feature says the apps will appear during searches and in the Apps and Gaming tabs within the app. Developers will be able to track whether and where users see the ads and whether they're downloading and opening the apps once they see the ads.\n\nReach the right customers at the right time with your games and apps\nContent is at the heart of the Windows PC experience. Consumers typically visit the Microsoft Store to learn more about a wide variety of PC apps or games, from productivity apps that accelerate work to creativity apps that empower innovation, games that incentivize connection, and more. Because most consumers live a multi-screen life\u2014moving from smartphones to PCs and back again\u2014the lines between \u201cmobile\u201d and \u201cdesktop\u201d have blurred. In turn, the behaviors consumers are accustomed to on mobile are transferable to the way people expect apps on PCs to look, feel, and function. Developers know that apps are central to how we work, play, and connect. And the great news is PC apps are having their moment. From the pandemic accelerating PC use to app-savvy millennial and Gen-Z audiences growing up creating and using apps\u2014a wide audience is looking for app-centric experiences, not only on mobile, but on PCs, too.\n\nReach a wider app audience with Microsoft Store Ads\n\nOur passion for helping developers more easily bring their apps to customers inspired us to redesign the Microsoft Store on Windows\u2014which now features a new desktop app distribution experience that looks and feels more like mobile. Now, when customers visit the Microsoft Store, they can download apps for either mobile or PC.\n\nWith Microsoft Store Ads, developers now have new app discoverability opportunities on Windows. Microsoft Store Ads is all desktop traffic, with mission-driven users that have a high intent to download a desktop app. The opportunity is vast; 2022 was a record year, with over 900 million unique users worldwide utilizing the Microsoft Store, and a 122% year-over-year increase in developer submissions of new apps and games.\n\nMicrosoft Store Ads was designed to help developers grow their business by getting their apps or games in front of the right customers at the right time, and to inspire Microsoft Store customers with great content. A developer of a music-making app, for example, will be able to create an ad campaign to get their app in front of an audience that likes music or likes to create music.\n\nWhether you\u2019re about to launch a brand-new app or have a 2.0 bug update for an app currently on the Windows Store, developers can now advertise right on the Microsoft Store, to incentivize people to install or update.\n\nAll developers are welcome\nWe are now offering a new set of Open App Store Principles that welcome all developers to bring the best apps and games to Windows 11 devices, from apps using their own commerce to third-party storefronts. And last year, we announced a waitlist program for Win32 apps in Microsoft Store and welcomed hundreds of developers. Today, we are pleased to share that the program is now open to all Win32 developers (.NET, C++, Electron, Flutter, Qt, Rust, and more). If your app or game is not in the Microsoft Store yet, begin by publishing your Windows app.\n\nAll developers have access to Microsoft Store Ads, where they can create ad campaigns in the Microsoft Store, using Microsoft Advertising, reaching customers on Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices. However, only developers with published content on the Store will be able to run ad campaigns, which ensures ads are contextual for customers.\n\nGet started today\nMicrosoft Store Ads is built for apps already on Windows\u2014and for your latest release. Now is the time to promote and invest in your desktop app. Having just announced ads on the Microsoft StoreOpens in new window, the costs per click (CPC) are very competitive, which can bring your overall cost per action (CPA) down.\n\nWe recommend developers reach out to their marketing team to create a strategic app marketing plan leveraging Microsoft Store Ads. Let the team know that with Microsoft Store Ads you promote your desktop app to customers on Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices by creating ads on the Microsoft Advertising platform. Once created, developers will see their app advertised live right on the Microsoft Store. Customers will click the ad, download or update the app to their PC, and let the writing, playing, or gaming come to life.", "input": ""}

A time where many people suffered just by seeing others being hurt. This tragedy is Covid-19.\n\n \n\n During this time, there might be a stream of negative news, which might make you overwhelmed and worried. You have the choice to pick whether you want to look at a problem with a positive attitude and take it as a challenge or a negative attitude and worry about it. It is all up to you.\nOptimism or pessimism?\n\nOptimism means to look at problems on the bright side. There's ALWAYS a bright side to problems, no matter how big the problem is. You might think, covid-19 is more than just a big problem. It\u2019s a huge problem. Millions of people died from this disease around the world. If you want a change in life, you have to be the change. Like Mohandas Gandhi said \u201cYou must be the change you wish to see in the world.\u201d \nCovid-19 has helped me discover the optimism within me because it helped see the bright side of problems, something that can be really hard to do. Because of covid-19, we had to stay at home. Parents had to work from home, and kids had to learn from home. But since everyone was at home, there was more family time, and everyone got to know each other just a bit better. Even if we all go to school in person now, you can\u2019t go somewhere too far away, as there could be a risk of you getting the disease. Because of this, now we get more family time.\n\n I am going to use the optimism that covid-19 has given me to achieve the goals that I have for the future. I am going to use the optimism covid-19 has given to help with tests, and make grades go up. I can achieve anything with optimism and so can everyone in this world.

Rewrite and paraphrase the following paragraph for metehara state farm, ethiopia without changing the nomenclature without losing citation and references \n\nThere are longstanding concerns that freshwater resources are insufficient to satisfy the increasing demand from various segments of human society. However, water allocation is slanted towards industry and domestic use primarily due to their economic benefits. Therefore, a dwindling agricultural water supply due to inadequate allocation is becoming a barrier to agriculture and husbandry in some parts of the world, even areas where farming lifestyles have been dominant for hundreds of years. Agricultural regions with arid climates such as the Nile basin in Egypt and Syria suffer from additional water stress due to an imbalance between ET and precipitation, usually leading to over-exploitation of aquifers and even water-related conflicts [1,2]. involved planting young trees led to an approximate 25% increase in water consumption. Overall, since 2012, the water-saving project has achieved satisfactory performance regarding excessive groundwater withdrawal, showing a reduction trend of 3 million m3/year and an increase in Lake Aiding water levels since 2011. The results reveal the potential of the ET monitoring strategy as a basis for basin-scale water management.\nGlobally, the spatial inhomogeneity of water resources is primarily affected by climate, which is difficult to change with human action. However, local and regional water management and re-allocation could be conducted to match the local topography and land surface patterns to better utilize water storage and runoff patterns [3]. Studies to optimize water allocation have been proposed worldwide and are available to policy makers [4\u20138]. In addition to guiding water into appropriate areas, advanced irrigation technology (e.g., sprinkler and drip) can be applied to improve water use efficiency (WUE) by reducing non-beneficial soil consumption [9,10]. However, inadequate allocation and irrigation programmes provide no water-saving guarantees because they typically fail to consider the hydrological cycle as a whole system [11]. The relationship between water consumption dynamics in water-saving measures should also be considered. In reality, both systematic designation and stepwise policy optimization through monitoring are required.\nWater conservation projects have been proposed to save water from several aspects, especially in the arid north-western areas of China. Except for dams built to store floodwater for the dry season, investments in China have mainly targeted improved water delivery infrastructure and irrigation technologies. However, these measures may not always achieve a reduction of real water consumption from crops [12]. Optimized infrastructure can greatly reduce percolation but provide no guarantee of real water saving. This approach simply allocates reduced water resources to specific uses. In fact, overall water consumption in a basin may even increase ET and exacerbate the water scarcity. It is easy to imagine a scenario in which growing high-value crops, such as fruit, becomes easier with sufficient water supply provided by the improved drainage and irrigation system, resulting in increased total water consumption due to the expansion of fruit cultivation. In some regions, a reduced water supply might be more susceptible to contamination by saline aquifer or runoff into the sea [11]. Due to the outmoded management strategies, in some parts of China, surface and groundwater over-exploitation resulting from irrigated agriculture has led to ecosystem deterioration [13]. Thus, conservation projects require both adoption and constant optimization with assistance from timely monitoring results to achieve true water savings.\nRemote sensing (RS) images can provide spatially distributed, time-series data of the earth\u2019s surface at diverse resolutions and have been proven to be a reliable source for monitoring water consumption [14\u201316]. Researchers worldwide have designed satellite-based ET models with satisfactory reliability [10,17,18]. Over the past decade, management and allocation projects have capitalized on satellite-based ET monitoring to relieve water stress [19\u201321]. Anderson lists several applications that employ moderate-resolution ET maps (30-m) to reflect the ecosystem response to\nwater management [22]. In addition, an Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model has been used to monitor water consumption in two American regions, including the Palo Verde Irrigation District, which has an arid climate [23,24]. The results show that there is a high correlation between total water consumption and human activity, especially with respect to irrigation in arid regions. ET from local plants consumes approximately 70% of total terrestrial rainfall [11]. Therefore,\nwater consumption by vegetation should be effectively controlled and managed. However, due to differences in surface conditions, no universally applicable monitoring strategy exists. For example, large homogeneous farmland areas (over 100 ha) are rare in northwest China, which usually causes RS pixels to be mixed. Therefore, the 4-km pixels from reference ET data are not fine grained enough to reveal ET spikes after local irrigation [24]. Moreover, developing a unified spatial resolution of an ET map that is suitable for analysis from different aspects is impractical. Data with low spatial resolution are available at higher frequencies and over longer time series, but responses from ecosystems and human society to the water-saving policy are necessary to maintain a sustainable cycle,\nwhich could be monitored by more detailed analysis. Therefore, an integrated ET monitoring strategy should be designed and conducted considering different monitoring tasks and their corresponding resolution requirements.\nIn this study, an ET monitoring approach that uses two spatial resolutions was designed for the Turpan Oasis, which has an extremely arid climate. Since 2006, the region has experienced farmland expansion due to policy and migration from other provinces. In late 2011, the local government began investing in a water protection project, and drastic variations in agricultural and ecological policies make this area a valuable case study for water management monitoring. The main objectives of this study were: (a) to evaluate the monitoring strategy\u2019s performance in an extremely arid region using data from 2006 to 2016; (b) to analyse the spatiotemporal dynamics by employing validated ET results; (c) to summarize the agriculture and ecological responses to the water-saving policy; and (d) to assess the successes and challenges in current ET monitoring strategy. Section 2 introduces the methods and data involved in this study. Section 3 presents ET simulation results and a detailed analysis based on ET monitoring. Section 4 provides a discussion of the entire monitoring study. Conclusions and a summary of the study are presented in Section 5.", "input": ""}

For years, he had been the subject of curiosity and speculation among the villagers, who only caught occasional glimpses of the talented man through the windows of his secluded cottage. Rumors whispered of his tragic past, yet nobody dared to intrude upon his solitude. \n\nOne stormy evening, as the village was blanketed by the somber gray of dusk, a young woman named Isabella sought shelter at Alexander's door. Drenched and disoriented, she knocked gently, her heart thudding with trepidation. After a few moments, the door creaked open, revealing Alexander's weathered face, lined with sorrow but softened by surprise.\n\n\"Can I help you, my dear?\" he asked, his voice like a melancholic symphony.\n\nIsabella stuttered her apologies for disturbing him, explaining that she had lost her way in the tempestuous downpour. Sensing her genuine need for refuge, Alexander invited her inside, where the fragrance of old books and aged instruments mingled in the air.\n\nOver time, a tentative friendship blossomed between the two. Alexander discovered that Isabella, too, was a musician, carrying her violin with her on her journey. In their shared love for music, they found solace. As the days passed, they played their instruments together, creating harmonies that seemed to resonate with the very soul of the village.\n\nChapter Two: The Faded Score\n\nAs the bond between Alexander and Isabella deepened, the village began to change. The haunting melodies that emanated from their cottage drew villagers from far and wide, their souls stirred by the enchanting music. Slowly, the somber shadows that loomed over the village lifted, replaced by newfound hope and camaraderie.\n\nYet, even as happiness coursed through the village, a silent sadness shrouded Alexander's heart. Every night, he would retreat to a hidden room within the cottage, where old scores lay untouched, bearing memories he had locked away for years. Isabella, sensing his pain, longed to understand the source of his sorrow.\n\nOne evening, as they sat by the fire, Isabella delicately broached the topic. \"Alexander, I can feel the weight of your past in the melodies you play. Tell me, what haunts your heart?\"\n\nAlexander hesitated, the embers of the fire reflecting in his distant eyes. With a heavy sigh, he began to unravel the tapestry of his life. He spoke of a long-lost love, a gifted pianist named Lillian, whose vibrant laughter echoed in his dreams. Fate had cruelly separated them, and Alexander believed he could never find joy in music again.\n\nChapter Three: The Symphony of Healing\n\nMoved by Alexander's tale, Isabella resolved to help him find closure. She implored him to compose once more, to pour his emotions onto the pages of a new score. Reluctantly, he agreed, but the music that flowed from him was tinged with both pain and beauty.\n\nAs they performed together, the village bore witness to a spectacle of emotions woven into the very fabric of sound. Tears mingled with applause, for they knew that something extraordinary was being born from sorrow and healing.\n\nOne day, as the sun bathed the village in a golden glow, Alexander and Isabella stood before the villagers, ready to perform the piece that held the essence of their journey. It was a symphony of healing, a tapestry woven with threads of love and loss, resilience and hope. Every note reverberated through the hearts of the listeners, an ethereal echo of eternity.\n\nChapter Four: A New Overture\n\nWith the symphony's last note fading into the horizon, Alexander and Isabella shared a profound glance, realizing that their journey together had come full circle. The music had not only healed Alexander's wounded heart but had brought the entire village together, uniting them in the embrace of music's timeless power.\n\nAs the years passed, Alexander and Isabella continued to inspire each other, creating melodies that embraced both joy and sorrow. Their music became an eternal bond, a testament to the transformative power of art.\n\nAnd so, the village, once shrouded in the quietude of loneliness, now thrived with the resonant symphony of life. The forgotten melody had found its voice once more, echoing through the ages, a testament to the eternal magic of music and the power of love to heal the deepest wounds of the soul."}

This growth has been largely attributed to increased consumer spending, boosted by the release of pent-up demand from lockdown periods, as well as strong government stimulus packages.\n1. Inflation Remains a Concern\nDespite the positive economic indicators, inflation remains a cause for concern in many regions. As demand has surged, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages have resulted in rising costs for businesses. Central banks are closely monitoring the situation, with some countries already implementing measures to manage inflationary pressures. However, the delicate balance of curbing inflation without hampering economic growth poses a significant challenge for policymakers.\n1. Global Trade and Supply Chain Recovery\nInternational trade has seen a steady recovery, aided by the easing of travel restrictions and improved logistics. The normalization of trade flows has had a positive impact on various industries, leading to increased production and better availability of goods. Nevertheless, the pandemic's lingering effects continue to create uncertainties in the supply chain, highlighting the need for diversified sourcing strategies and greater resilience.\n1. Energy Transition and Green Investments\nThe global shift towards sustainable practices and green investments continues to gather momentum. Governments and businesses are increasingly focusing on renewable energy sources, eco-friendly infrastructure projects, and adopting more stringent climate policies. This transition to a greener economy offers opportunities for innovation and job creation, but also challenges for industries heavily reliant on fossil fuels.\n1. Geopolitical Tensions and Trade Disputes\nDespite the encouraging economic developments, geopolitical tensions and trade disputes have not entirely subsided. Trade negotiations, currency manipulation accusations, and tariffs remain contentious topics among nations. Such conflicts introduce uncertainties in the global economy, affecting investment decisions and supply chain operations.\nIn conclusion, the global economy is witnessing positive signs of recovery amidst the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic and geopolitical tensions. Governments and businesses are adopting cautious optimism, aiming to strike a delicate balance between supporting growth and managing inflation. The path to sustained recovery remains dependent on continued efforts to address public health concerns, strengthen global trade ties, and navigate the transition towards a more sustainable and resilient economic future."}

It grapples with questions concerning existence, knowledge, morality, and the very essence of being. One of the most intriguing philosophical discussions revolves around the interplay of truth and perception. This essay aims to explore the intricate relationship between these two elements and their profound impact on shaping our understanding of the world and ourselves.\nSection I: The Nature of Truth\nTruth, at its core, is the representation of an objective reality that corresponds to facts, independent of human beliefs or perceptions. Philosophers have grappled with the nature of truth for centuries, leading to various theories and perspectives. The correspondence theory of truth, for instance, posits that a statement is true if it accurately corresponds to the state of affairs in the external world. On the other hand, the coherence theory emphasizes internal consistency and logical coherence as the basis of truth.\nNevertheless, achieving an unequivocal grasp of truth remains elusive, as our understanding is limited by human perception, language, and cognition. The complexities of reality and the limitations of human knowledge give rise to a crucial question: is absolute truth attainable, or do we merely approach it asymptotically?\nSection II: The Subjectivity of Perception\nPerception, as the means through which we interpret the world, plays an integral role in shaping our understanding of truth. It encompasses sensory experiences, cognitive processes, cultural influences, and individual biases, making it inherently subjective. Our perceptions color our reality, often leading to different interpretations of the same events or objects.\nFurthermore, perceptual relativism suggests that truth is contingent upon the observer's perspective, leading to a multiplicity of \"truths\" existing simultaneously. This raises a profound philosophical challenge: if truth varies depending on individual perspectives, does an objective reality even exist, or is reality merely a tapestry of diverse perceptions?\nSection III: The Paradox of Objective-Subjective Duality\nThe tension between objective truth and subjective perception gives rise to a philosophical paradox. On one hand, we seek universal and objective truths as a means to discover a stable foundation upon which to build our understanding of the world. On the other hand, our very means of apprehending these truths is through our subjective consciousness.\nAs we delve deeper into this paradox, we encounter intriguing questions regarding the relationship between truth and perception. Does objective truth transcend human perception, or is it inseparably intertwined with subjective interpretations? Can we ever attain objectivity in our understanding of the world, or are we doomed to experience reality solely through the lens of our subjectivity?\nSection IV: The Power of Perspectives\nRather than viewing the interplay of truth and perception as a contradiction, we can appreciate it as a dynamic interdependence. Our diverse perspectives enrich the discourse of truth, broadening our understanding of complex issues and leading to new insights. Embracing multiple perspectives enables us to approach truth more comprehensively, although it remains inherently multifaceted.\nThrough dialogues, debates, and the exchange of ideas, we refine our understanding of truth by navigating the vast landscape of perceptions. While absolute objectivity may elude us, we can strive for a shared understanding that transcends individual biases and prejudices.\nConclusion\nThe interplay of truth and perception reveals a profound and intricate relationship that permeates our existence. While objective truth might exist independently of human perception, our understanding is inevitably colored by our subjectivity. The pursuit of truth becomes a collaborative endeavor, where diverse perspectives enrich the quest for a more comprehensive understanding.\nAs we engage in philosophical contemplation, we come to recognize that truth is not an isolated entity but rather a tapestry woven by the threads of human consciousness. Embracing this dynamic interdependence allows us to appreciate the beauty of our diverse perspectives while seeking common ground in our search for a more profound comprehension of the world and ourselves. In the end, it is the very interplay of truth and perception that defines the richness of our philosophical journey."}

These enigmatic cosmic entities, formed from the remnants of massive stars, possess a gravitational force so powerful that not even light can escape their grasp. In this article, we delve into the fascinating world of black holes, exploring their origins, properties, and the cutting-edge research aimed at understanding these celestial marvels.\n1. Introduction: The Birth of Black Holes\nBlack holes are celestial objects characterized by their enormous gravitational pull, resulting from the collapse of massive stars at the end of their life cycles. As the star's core exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer support the inward gravitational pressure, leading to a catastrophic implosion. The star then undergoes gravitational collapse, forming a black hole.\n2. Anatomy of a Black Hole\nBlack holes are described by three main components: the event horizon, singularity, and ergosphere. The event horizon is the point beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the black hole's gravitational pull. It defines the boundary between the observable universe and the mysterious interior. At the heart of the black hole lies the singularity, a point of infinite density where the laws of physics, as we currently understand them, break down. Surrounding the event horizon, the ergosphere is a region where the black hole's rotation drags spacetime itself, enabling energy extraction processes such as the Penrose process.\n3. Types of Black Holes\nBlack holes are broadly categorized into three types based on their mass: stellar black holes, intermediate-mass black holes, and supermassive black holes. Stellar black holes typically have a mass several times that of our sun and are the most common type. Intermediate-mass black holes fall between stellar and supermassive black holes, and while evidence suggests their existence, they remain challenging to detect. Supermassive black holes, found at the centers of most galaxies, have masses ranging from hundreds of thousands to billions of times that of our sun.\n4. Unraveling the Secrets of Supermassive Black Holes\nResearchers continue to explore the origins and evolution of supermassive black holes, believed to play a vital role in shaping galaxies and the universe's large-scale structure. Various theories propose that these cosmic giants form through direct collapse from massive gas clouds or through successive mergers of smaller black holes and accretion of surrounding matter.\n5. Black Hole Phenomena and Their Signatures\nThe immense gravitational forces of black holes produce fascinating phenomena. Among them are accretion disks, swirling rings of gas and dust that radiate immense energy, making black holes detectable through X-rays and other emissions. Jets of high-energy particles, accelerated near black holes' event horizons, can extend thousands of light-years into space, influencing their galactic environments.\n6. Black Holes and Quantum Mechanics\nThe study of black holes has led to intriguing connections with quantum mechanics, particularly through the concept of Hawking radiation. Proposed by physicist Stephen Hawking, this theoretical radiation suggests that black holes can emit particles and energy, gradually losing mass and ultimately evaporating. If confirmed, this finding could reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity, revolutionizing our understanding of the universe's fundamental laws.\n7. Black Hole Observations and Instrumentation\nAdvanced astronomical instruments, including radio telescopes, X-ray observatories, and gravitational wave detectors, have provided valuable insights into black holes and their behavior. These instruments have enabled scientists to study black hole mergers, accretion processes, and gravitational wave emissions, deepening our comprehension of these cosmic enigmas.\n8. Black Holes and the Fabric of Spacetime\nBlack holes have not only expanded our knowledge of the cosmos but also challenged our understanding of space and time. The study of black holes has inspired investigations into the nature of spacetime, the possibilities of wormholes, and the enigma of singularities\u2014where classical physics' rules no longer apply.\n9. The Future of Black Hole Research\nAs technology and observational capabilities improve, scientists anticipate even greater revelations about black holes and their role in the universe. Future studies might explore the potential of primordial black holes, investigate the existence of microscopic black holes, and unravel the relationship between black holes and dark matter.\n10. Conclusion\nBlack holes continue to be one of the most captivating and profound mysteries in astrophysics. The study of these cosmic beasts has already enriched our understanding of gravity, space, and time. As we venture further into the realm of these enigmatic singularities, new discoveries await, promising to unveil more of the universe's well-guarded secrets."}

While recent works have achieved impressive results in generating motion directly from textual action descriptions, they often support only a single modality of the control signal, which limits their application in the real digital human industry. This paper presents a Motion General-Purpose generaTor (MotionGPT) that can use multimodal control signals, e.g., text and single-frame poses, for generating consecutive human motions by treating multimodal signals as special input tokens in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first quantize multimodal control signals into discrete codes and then formulate them in a unified prompt instruction to ask the LLMs to generate the motion answer. Our MotionGPT demonstrates a unified human motion generation model with multimodal control signals by tuning a mere 0.4% of LLM parameters. To the best of our knowledge, MotionGPT is the first method to generate human motion by multimodal control signals, which we hope can shed light on this new direction.

Tensions had been simmering for years due to various factors, including British taxation policies and perceived lack of representation in Parliament. The conflict ignited with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775, and over the next eight years, the Continental Army, led by figures like George Washington, fought against the well-trained and well-equipped British forces. Despite facing numerous challenges and hardships, the colonists' resilience and determination eventually led to their triumph, culminating in the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which officially recognized the United States as an independent nation, ending British colonial rule and setting the stage for the birth of a new country. The American Revolutionary War remains a pivotal moment in history, inspiring subsequent movements for liberty and democracy around the world."}

{"category": "information_extraction", "instruction": "Please read the attached news article and extract the main points related to the economy and international trade.", "input": "Global Trade Soars as Economies Rebound from Pandemic Slump\n\nIn a remarkable turn of events, the world economy has experienced a significant rebound following the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. International trade has been a driving force behind this recovery, with countries ramping up their efforts to boost exports and revive their economies.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the World Trade Organization (WTO), global trade volumes have surged by 10% in the first half of this year. This unexpected jump marks the fastest growth rate in trade since the Great Recession, highlighting the resilience and adaptability of nations in the face of adversity.\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to this uptick in international trade. The easing of lockdown measures in various countries has led to increased consumer demand, propelling the export of goods and services. Additionally, the successful distribution of vaccines worldwide has bolstered business confidence and spurred investments in various industries.\n\nOne notable trend in the current economic landscape is the dominance of emerging markets in global trade. Countries such as China, India, and Brazil have seen their export volumes surge, outpacing many developed economies. This shift reflects a changing dynamic in the global economy, with emerging markets becoming key players in international trade.\n\nDespite these positive developments, there remain challenges on the horizon. The resurgence of COVID-19 variants in some regions has raised concerns about potential disruptions to supply chains. Additionally, geopolitical tensions between major trading partners have added an element of uncertainty to the future of international trade.\n\nIn response to these challenges, governments worldwide are seeking to strengthen economic ties through bilateral and multilateral agreements. Recently, a landmark trade deal was signed between the European Union and a group of Asian countries, aiming to facilitate smoother trade flows and promote economic cooperation.\n\nFurthermore, the adoption of digital technologies has played a crucial role in streamlining cross-border trade. E-commerce platforms and digital payment systems have made it easier for businesses to access international markets and consumers to purchase goods from abroad.\n\nIn conclusion, the global economy is witnessing a remarkable recovery, with international trade acting as a key driver behind this resurgence. The substantial growth in trade volumes and the rise of emerging markets as major players have transformed the economic landscape. However, challenges remain, necessitating continuous efforts to strengthen economic ties and adapt to changing circumstances in the post-pandemic world."}
{"category": "information_extraction", "instruction": "From the Passage please find out what are the cause of climate change", "input": "In common usage, climate change describes global warming\u2014the ongoing increase in global average temperature\u2014and its effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane. Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.\n\nDue to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise."}

The research highlights the escalating consequences of global warming, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and agriculture. Utilizing the latest data, the paper underscores the urgent need for comprehensive mitigation strategies, such as renewable energy adoption, afforestation, sustainable agriculture, and energy efficiency measures, to avert the worst effects of climate change.\n\nIntroduction\nClimate change remains one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with dire implications for the planet and its inhabitants. This paper aims to present the latest statistics on climate change impacts and causes while emphasizing the importance of immediate and effective mitigation measures.\n\nImpacts of Climate Change: New Statistics\n2.1. Escalating Sea Levels\nRecent data reveals that global sea levels have risen at an average rate of 3.6 millimeters per year over the past decade, almost double the rate of the previous century. By 2100, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates a sea-level rise of up to 1 meter, which poses an imminent threat to coastal populations and ecosystems.\n\n2.2. Increasing Frequency of Extreme Weather Events\nNew statistics indicate a significant surge in extreme weather events worldwide. Over the past five years, the occurrence of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes has increased by 20%, leading to devastating impacts on vulnerable communities and infrastructure.\n\n2.3. Ecosystem Disruptions and Biodiversity Loss\nThe latest assessments indicate that climate change has already contributed to the loss of approximately 1 million species, with many more at risk of extinction. Changing climate patterns are disrupting ecosystems, affecting habitats, migration patterns, and the delicate balance of ecosystems.\n\n2.4. Agricultural Challenges\nRecent data highlights that crop yields have decreased by an average of 5% globally over the last decade due to climate-related factors. This alarming trend threatens food security and livelihoods for millions of people, particularly in regions dependent on agriculture.\n\n2.5. Health Risks Amplification\nNew research suggests that the health impacts of climate change are more severe than previously estimated. An increase in heatwaves and air pollution has resulted in a rise in heat-related illnesses, respiratory diseases, and other climate-sensitive health conditions.\n\nCauses of Climate Change\n3.1. Mounting Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nThe latest statistics demonstrate a concerning rise in global greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reached a record high of 40.9 billion metric tons in the past year, primarily driven by fossil fuel combustion and industrial activities.\n\nUrgent Mitigation Strategies\n4.1. Rapid Transition to Renewable Energy\nBased on recent advancements in renewable energy technology, transitioning to renewable sources like solar and wind power is critical to reducing GHG emissions and limiting global warming.\n\n4.2. Large-Scale Afforestation and Reforestation\nNew studies emphasize the potential of afforestation and reforestation efforts in sequestering vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Encouraging global tree planting initiatives can play a crucial role in climate change mitigation.\n\n4.3. Sustainable Agricultural Practices\nRecent data confirms that sustainable agricultural practices, such as precision farming, agroforestry, and reduced tillage, not only contribute to reduced emissions but also enhance soil carbon storage, bolstering climate resilience.\n\n4.4. Energy Efficiency and Conservation Measures\nUpdated statistics underscore the significance of energy efficiency measures in curbing emissions. Implementing energy-efficient technologies in buildings, industries, and transportation can substantially reduce energy consumption and associated GHG emissions.\n\nConclusion\nThe latest statistics leave no room for doubt: climate change is an urgent and escalating crisis that requires immediate action. By acknowledging the new data on its impacts and causes, we can better comprehend the magnitude of the problem and focus on science-based mitigation strategies. Through collaborative efforts at the international, national, and individual levels, humanity can forge a sustainable path, safeguarding the planet and future generations from the worst consequences of climate change."}

The public Hawaiian language immersion school is located in Kealakekua, a rural town on the west side of the Big Island.\n\nIt has also surpassed academic expectations, making its adequate yearly progress targets in five of the last six years, while student scores on the Hawaii State Assessment have shown dramatic improvement year after year in both reading and math.\n\nThe school, known as \u2018Ehunui for short, is one of only 22 such Hawaiian language immersion schools in the state of Hawaii. Just a handful of its students do not have any Hawaiian ethnicity.\n\n\u201cThe premise of Hawaiian language immersion schools is to revive and perpetuate the Hawaiian language, which was basically banned and heading toward extinction due to colonization,\u201d Lino said. \u201cThere has been a strong movement in the last 20 years to establish validity and purpose for the Hawaiian people. This educational framework is part of that movement.\u201d\n\nEarly grades are taught entirely in Hawaiian and English is introduced into classroom instruction in the fifth grade. By middle school, content is delivered in both languages. But the school does more than just foster bilingual fluency among its K-12 students.\n\n\u201cEducation has been inserted into our students\u2019 culture, as opposed to culture being inserted into their education,\u201d he said. \u201cOverall, it also gives Native Hawaiian children an improved sense of self-identity and creates a learning environment which is culturally relevant and responsive.\u201d\n\nThe framework of the school is built upon the concepts of \u201cNa Honua Mauli Ola,\u201d or culturally healthy and responsive learning environments. The six cultural guiding themes are cultural identity, wisdom, sense of place, sense of discovery, sense of self and perspective or cultural lens, Lino said.\n\nThe school garden project is one example of a culture- and place-based practice prevalent with their ancestors, Lino said. It is integrated into all core academic areas as students learn to use traditional Hawaiian methods of cultivation for their garden.\n\nBefore planting the first seeds, students and their teachers chant and dance to bless the new garden space and ask for fertility for their crops.\n\nLino came on board as principal in 2002 to oversee the transition of \u2019Ehunui from a school-within-a-school to its own self-contained campus, and he has since watched it flourish. Students face high expectations when it comes to their academic achievement at the school.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense of hope for Native Hawaiian children, who are traditionally labeled as low achievers with low motivation,\u201d Lino said. \u201cOur school functions under the mantra of \u2018success is the only option.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd success has been the outcome so far.\n\nLino said his experience in the Ed.D. program has affirmed his work at \u2018Ehunui.\n\n\u201cMost of what we have been exposed to and learned through the Ed.D. program is directly applicable to my daily work and mission,\u201d he said. Drummondo: I don\u2019t see or expect (forfeits) to happen where the coaches or admin will make that decision. What worries me is numbers island-wide, where teams sustain injuries in weeks 6-9, and always, academic probation.\n\nHPW: I can\u2019t help remembering when Waiakea struggled for years, and Tim Lino took over as coach and within two years, they had a championship run that lasted for four seasons during his watch. Do you think the program is at a point where it could potentially fold?\n\nDrummondo: I wasn\u2019t here when Coach Lino had his dynasty going. I hear a lot of stories. We have a lot of guys who played for Lino or coached under him. It\u2019s still a prideful program. The state just invested millions of dollars in their stadium. They have great athletes at that program. I don\u2019t see them folding.\"", "input": ""}

{"category": "reading_comprehension", "instruction": "Title: The Benefits and Components of Solar Energy for Home Use\n\nGreenpeace has emphasized the advantages of using solar energy for domestic purposes, which enable users to generate their own electricity. With the decreasing costs of technology, solar systems have become more accessible and affordable for households to install. Solar energy is considered democratic since it is widely popular among users, and governments should encourage its use.\n\nThe primary components of a self-consumption photovoltaic system include solar panels, an inverter, energy storage, wiring and structure, and safety devices. Solar panels are responsible for converting sunlight directly into electricity. The inverter, on the other hand, converts the direct current generated by the panels into the alternating current used in households. Energy storage is essential to ensure a constant supply of electricity when the panels do not produce enough energy. The wiring and structure of the panels must be robust and installed in a location without shade or obstacles. Other devices, such as monitors and safety controllers, are also available to provide added benefits.\n\nBy understanding these components, homeowners can install their own solar systems and generate clean energy. Solar energy has numerous benefits, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, lowering energy bills, and increasing energy independence. Additionally, using solar power can potentially increase the value of a home.\n\nGovernments should take an active role in promoting the use of solar energy. Policies that incentivize homeowners to install solar systems, such as tax credits or subsidies, can help accelerate the transition to clean energy. Encouraging research and development in the solar industry can also lead to more efficient and cost-effective technology.\n\nIn conclusion, solar energy for home use offers numerous benefits, and the decreasing costs of technology have made it more accessible to households. The components of a self-consumption photovoltaic system are relatively simple and easy to understand, allowing homeowners to generate clean energy and potentially save money on energy bills. Governments should promote the use of solar energy and invest in research and development to continue improving this renewable energy source.\n\nWhat is the primary function of an inverter in a self-consumption photovoltaic system for solar energy?\n\nA) Convert sunlight into electricity.\nB) Store excess energy for later use.\nC) Convert direct current to alternating current.\nD) Monitor and control safety devices.", "input": ""}

How can you prove that education in Russia is going through a transitional period?\n\nAnswer these questions. they refer to this text:\nRussians have always shown a great concern for education. The right to education is stated in the Constitution of the educational Russian Federation. It is ensured by compulsory secondary schools, Vocational schools, and higher establishments. It is also ensured by the development of extra- mural and evening courses and the system of state scholarships and grants. Education in Russia is compulsory to the 9th form inclusive. The stages of compulsory schooling in Russia are: 2primary education for ages 6-7 to 9-10 inclusive; secondary education including intermediate school for ages 10-11 to 12-13 inclusive, and senior high school for ages 13-14 to 14-15 inclusive. If a pupil of a secondary school wishes to go on in higher education, he or she must stay at school for two more years. Primary and secondary school together comprise 11 years of studies. Every school has a \"core curriculum\" of academic subjects, such as Russian, literature, mathematics, history, a foreign language and others. Lyceums and gymnasiums offer programs giving a profound knowledge in some field of study. After finishing the 9th form one can go on to a vocational school which offers programmes of academic subjects and a programme of training in a technical field, or a profession. After finishing the 11th form of a secondary school, a lyceum or a gymnasium one can go on in higher education. All applicants must taken competitive examinations. Higher educational institutions, that is, institutes, academies or universities, offer a 5-year programme of academic subjects in a variety of fields, as well as a graduate course. If one finishes a graduate course and writes a thesis, he or she receives the candidate degree, corresponding to the master's degree, or the doctoral degree. Higher educational establishments are headed by Rectors. Prorectors are in charge of academic and scientific work. An institute or a university has a number of faculties, each specializing in a field of study. Faculties have specialized councils which confer candidate and doctoral degrees. The system of secondary and higher education in Russia is going through a transitional period. As a result of it Russia took part in the international reform of higher education and signed the Bologna Declaration in 2003. The main objectives of the reform are: to decentralize the higher education system, to develop a new financial mechanism, to give more academic freedoms to faculties and students, (to introduce two stages of education in higher institutions - Baccalaureate and Magistrate, to increase Russian higher education competitiveness on the world scale. Now Russia completes the integration into the European Higher Educational Area. All secondary schools, institutes, academies and universities until recently have been funded by the state.

This historic vessel is believed to have been built around 890 AD and is considered to be one of the largest and best-preserved Viking ships ever found.\n\nThe Gokstad Ship was originally used as a burial ship for a Viking chieftain, and was found with numerous artifacts, including weapons, tools, and clothing. These items provided valuable insight into the lives and customs of the Vikings during this time period.\n\nThe ship itself is approximately 23 meters (75 feet) in length and 5 meters (16 feet) in width, with a shallow draft that would have allowed it to navigate through shallow waters and up rivers. It was constructed primarily of oak planks, with a single mast and a square sail that would have allowed it to travel long distances at a relatively fast pace.\n\nOne of the most notable features of the Gokstad Ship is its construction, which demonstrates the skilled craftsmanship of the Viking shipbuilders. The planks were carefully fitted together and secured with iron nails, while the keel was made of two large oak beams that were carefully shaped and fitted together to create a strong and stable foundation for the ship.", "input": ""}

{"category": "keywords_extraction", "instruction": "what is the thesis statement of this essay? give me an answer in 2 sentences: Outsider of Tea Culture\nEveryone is acquainted with tea. This is a household name that has a history of thousands of years. Chinese mythology aside, archeological evidence has been found indicating that tea was used as a medicine by the elite as early as the Han dynasty 206 BCE\u2013220 CE which is almost a thousand years ago (Meredith). Being from the generation of my great grandfather, my family also has a long history of sipping tea. Now, with the pace of people's lives getting faster and faster, a kind of \"instant tea\" came into being, like Lay's tea bag on the supermarket shelf. This kind of tea generally has a lot of flavors like lemon or peach flavor. People are gradually forgetting original tea cultures as society moves faster and faster. However, tea culture is a rich and diverse custom that has been practiced for centuries throughout the globe. From the ancient tea ceremonies of China and Japan to the bustling tea houses of India and the Middle East, tea has played a significant role in the social and cultural fabric of numerous societies. However, how many people know the culture or practices behind this familiar product? In other words, although I have been sipping tea for many years, I still regard myself as an outsider of this culture. (THESE STATEMENT)\nBefore we know what tea culture is, we should know what is culture? Raymond Williams calls culture \u201cone of the two or three most complicated words in the English language\u201d. First, culture can be used to refer to \u2018a general process of intellectual, spiritual and aesthetic development\u2019. A second use of the word \u2018culture\u2019 might be to suggest \u2018a particular way of life, whether of a people, a period or a group\u2019. Finally, Williams suggests that culture can be used to refer to \u2018the works and practices of intellectual and especially artistic activity\u2019(Williams 90). What is my definition of culture reflection with mine\nUnless you are in the environment mixed with the insider, otherwise definitely do not experience the so-called tea culture. Since it can be considered culture, it must have its spiritual connotation. In recent years, the word \"culture\" has become so prevalent that everything depends on culture. For example, people casually grab some tea at home, know nothing about what is thrown into the glass, and randomly pour boiling water down. Some might just take photos and post it with a prestigious word in social media and some might just swallow bottles of these liquids, and these are so-called \"tea culture\". \nAdmittedly, if we take a broad cultural perspective, we can't deny that this is not culture. When many of us use the word culture, we are outsiders. So what distinguishes us from the insiders and the outsiders, in other words what are the insiders of tea culture? From the characteristics of tea, it must be a few that can really touch the level of [culture]. Overall, the insider perspective of tea culture involves an understanding of the history, traditions, and values that are associated with tea in a particular region or culture, as well as the rituals and practices that have developed around the preparation, serving, and consumption of tea.The key word of \u201ctea culture\u201d in anthropologists\u2019 view of points is \u201cculture\u201d. As Wang Ling writes in her book: \u201cStudy of tea culture is not the study of the growth of tea cultivation, production, chemical components, pharmaceutical principles, function of health care, etc. These are the work of natural scientists. Our duty is to study the cultural and social phenomenon in the process of using tea\u201d (Ling 2013). Most people, though they have been drinking tea for decades, are simply a personal habit, far from the word \"insider\". \nI once went to a teahouse and experienced tea culture. Until today, I can still remember how I felt at that time. As soon as you enter the door, you can feel the strong smell of tea. The decoration in the store is elegant, simple and elegant. The clerk greeted me warmly and recommended black tea to me. I sat down and tasted this black tea, felt its mellow flavor, and enjoyed the tea culture and art works in the store. My mood gradually relaxed. The clerk told me that the black tea here comes from Fujian and is made from fresh buds when picking. The taste of tea is mellow and has a natural sweet taste. He also introduced me to the process of tea making and tea tasting methods, which made me have a deeper understanding of tea.\nIn the process of tea tasting, I found that there were also some tea ceremony and tea art performances in the teahouse, and the staff would also carry out some tea ceremony ceremonies with the guests. I was very interested, so I learned some basic tea ceremony rituals from the shop assistant, such as how to serve tea, how to taste tea, and so on. The tea teacher boiled the water in an iron pot, and then made tea in a ceramic pot and funnel. He brewed the tea several times until it unfolded and released its fragrance. I picked up the tea cup and smelled the fragrance of the tea. It exuded a light soil and wood flavor. Then, I took a sip. The taste was very special. It had a strong lingering charm, a little sour, sweet but not greasy, and slightly bitter. The tea soup is very thick and the taste is very smooth. The tea teacher said that this kind of tea can help to reduce fat, reduce fat and digest food. After drinking it, I feel much more comfortable in my stomach. While enjoying the fragrance of tea, I also watched the display of tea sets and tea art. There are various tea sets in the teahouse, including ceramics, silverware, glass and purple clay pots. The tea teacher demonstrated the traditional tea performance, including the technique of pouring tea soup from the pot and the method of tasting tea. In the tea ceremony, I felt a quiet, elegant and introverted beauty, and my mood became more peaceful.\nIn the teahouse, I also made some friends who like tea culture. We shared our love and experience of tea and exchanged our experiences and feelings. This makes me feel very warm, and the tea culture is also richer and more colorful because of this exchange. Not only making and tasting tea, but also communicating on the table is a kind of culture. Because sometimes the purpose of drinking tea is not only to drink, but also to promote communication and communication. From these disparate tea cultures, there are a few common themes that resonate with the tea drinkers of today. For the Chinese, Indians and Brits, tea was a way to bring people together. It was a shared experience and a chance to connect with other people.(Dwyer) Drinking tea can become a medium of communication, and places such as teahouses and teahouses are usually places for people to communicate. The brewing process of tea takes a certain amount of time, which can be used for chat and exchange. In the process of drinking tea, people can share each other's stories, experiences, feelings, or discuss some topics to enhance feelings and exchange ideas. Tea also helps to relieve physical and mental pressure, make people more relaxed and happy, and make it easier to carry out positive dialogue. At the same time, tea culture also brings a harmonious and peaceful atmosphere to people. In the teahouse, people usually maintain a quiet and elegant attitude, do not make noise, do not disturb others, and maintain a respectful attitude, which also helps the smooth communication.\nIn general, this experience of tea culture made me feel the charm and cultural connotation of tea, and made me like tea more. It not only makes me cherish the exchange and sharing between people more. Drinking tea is closely related to communication. Under the influence of tea culture, people can communicate more naturally and comfortably, and also enjoy the calm and harmonious atmosphere brought by tea culture.At the same time, I also deeply feel that as an outsider of tea culture. Although I have had a lot of tea at home since I was young, I have never known the specific technology and process of tea brewing and tasting. I have always thought that I am an insider, so I can be called an outsider. They are so unfamiliar with familiar things.", "input": ""}

In this marshy inlet, Spitzer checks for action in nests among 35 osprey platforms that have been erected here since the late 1950s. As he disembarks, the resident ospreys take to anxious flight. He raises a pole topped with a mirror over a platform nest. These days, he sees abundant breeding success in the mirror\u2019s reflection\u2014three healthy young birds with ragged crests and brown-spangled wings. But it wasn\u2019t always this way.\n\nSpitzer first stepped onto Great Island nearly 60 years ago, as an 11-year-old boy in 1957. That year, he accompanied birding legend Roger Tory Peterson on a Christmas Bird Count. Thus began a mentorship that set Spitzer onto a career path to becoming a ecologist.\n\nWhen Spitzer graduated from college, Peterson urged him to take up the question of what was causing a sudden and drastic decline among the ospreys.\n\n\u201cAt that time, the curtain was rising on the great DDT drama,\u201d says Spitzer.\n\nFrom the 1960s through the 1970s, Spitzer watched ospreys almost disappear from Connecticut, and he pioneered experiments that helped establish DDT as a cause of their decline. He has also seen ospreys make a triumphant recovery in the Connecticut River estuary. And with more than 300 active nests recorded in the state today, he is now turning his attention below the water, where the next challenge for osprey is a vanishing fish.\n\nThe Discovery of the Perils of DDT on Osprey Populations\nPeterson tracked the decline of local ospreys from 150 in the 1950s to just 13 in 1965. He and his wife Barbara tried to help the ospreys by building dozens of nest platforms to protect their nests from predators such as raccoons. But the birds still weren\u2019t bringing forth fledglings. Food didn\u2019t seem to be a problem\u2014there was no shortage of menhaden, the large-headed bait fish that is one of the osprey\u2019s primary food sources in Long Island Sound. Spitzer had spent hours watching the fish hawks rising from the water with menhaden nearly a foot long in their oversized talons.\n\n\u201cRoger began to suspect DDT,\u201d Spitzer says. In the 1940s and \u201850s, DDT was used to control mosquito populations in residential areas, especially along coasts and near wetlands. \u201cHe had a hunch the ospreys were ingesting the DDT from fish. Rachel Carson\u2019s findings were informing our discouraging field studies, and I was cutting my teeth as an ecologist studying this new paradigm of environmental toxicology.\u201d\n\nDuring nest checks, Spitzer found thin-shelled, collapsing eggs and was re-minded of a British study that showed similar thinning in peregrine falcon eggs.\n\nShortly after receiving his biology degree from Wesleyan University, Spitzer had the idea to isolate local ecological effects in Connecticut by switching eggs in osprey nests there with eggs from a healthy population of breeding osprey near Chesapeake Bay.\n\n\u201cNot nearly as much DDT was applied to Maryland saltmarshes, and it was probably diluted in the far larger Chesapeake system,\u201d says Spitzer. By performing the switch, he could isolate whether the problem was with local environmental conditions or intrinsic to the Connecticut eggs.\n\nThe Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland signed on to Spitzer\u2019s idea and provided staff to collect eggs. From the outset, Spitzer saw the Maryland eggs hatch healthy chicks in Connecticut, but not vice versa.\n\n\u201cThe embryos in Connecticut eggs died, and we found the shells to be thin by simple measurement,\u201d he says. \u201cWe also found dented or collapsed eggs in some Connecticut nests.\u201d None of these problems affected the Maryland eggs.\n\nNext, he arranged transfers of young nestlings from Maryland to Connecticut, to look beyond egg problems. The results were the same: \u201cVirtually all the Maryland nestlings fledged in Connecticut, [so there were] no problems with food at this time. The failure was egg viability,\u201d Spitzer says. Later lab tests revealed DDE (a breakdown product of DDT) as well as PCBs and another organochloride, dieldrin, at much higher concentrations in the Connecticut eggs compared to the Maryland eggs.\n\n\u201cAll signs pointed to Roger\u2019s hunch being right, that it was DDT,\u201d he says.\n\nDDT was banned in Connecticut in 1972, and two years later osprey numbers on Great Island bottomed out, with just a single nest remaining as the vestiges of DDT made their way out of the ecosystem.\n\nToday, there are approximately 100 active nests at Great Island and the overflow is helping populations at nearby Gardiners Island and eastern Long Island grow. Statewide, the Connecticut Audubon Society\u2019s osprey nation monitoring project recorded 337 active nests in 2016, and 490 fledged young throughout the state\u2014a rate nearly double that which Spitzer had calculated was necessary for a stable osprey population.\n\nNumbers like these, along with steady positive trends along Breeding Bird Survey routes, help explain why breeding ospreys are now abundant and widespread in Connecticut and throughout the eastern United States. Spitzer points to a combination of factors including an increase in artificial nest sites, a decrease in harmful residues in their food sources, and continued high levels of food availability, particularly Atlantic menhaden.\n\nOsprey and Menhaden\nFor the last three summers the Connecticut Audubon Society has sponsored Spitzer\u2019s ongoing work in the Connecticut River estuary, but the aim of the research has now shifted to monitoring the relationship between osprey and menhaden. As in the 1960s, Spitzer\u2019s attention is again focused on Great Island, now fittingly protected as a Roger Tory Peterson Wildlife Area. During June and July, Spitzer has documented that the ospreys\u2019 diet is 95 percent to 100 percent menhaden. Spitzer says the story is much the same from Connecticut to Virginia, with menhaden-fueled osprey nesting colonies experiencing a revival.\n\n\u201cOver 50 years of osprey study, we have moved from the sad story of DDT-induced egg failure and a declining population to the happy story of abundant ospreys,\u201d Spitzer says. \u201cOur ongoing legacy from osprey study must be the management of the East Coast ecosystem for abundant menhaden. We have to leave enough menhaden in the water to perform their precious and essential eco- nomic and ecological functions.\u201d\n\nRich in oils and fat, menhaden live in Atlantic coastal waters from Nova Scotia to northern Florida, but reach peak abundance in the Chesapeake Bay. In addition to serving as the primary food source for breeding ospreys and their chicks along the New England coast, menhaden are also a main food source for striped bass and bluefish. And, they constitute a significant fishery for people\u2014second only to pollock among the ranks of fish harvested by volume in the United States. But people don\u2019t eat menhaden for dinner. They process it into other forms, mostly pills.\n\nMost of the nearly 200,000-metric-ton annual menhaden catch is rendered into omega-3 fatty acid fish oil for the health supplement industry. And most of that catch comes via purse-seine fishing, in which two fishing boats circle around a single school of fish and enclose it within a gigantic net. These operations are extremely efficient at catching huge volumes of fish. Only one state (Virginia) currently allows purse-seine fishing of menhaden, but the fish caught in the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia waters account for 85 percent of the total menhaden harvest. \n\nBecause a large share of the range-wide menhaden population is clustered in the mid-Atlantic region, harvests there have a significant effect on the population as a whole. As the fish-oil market boomed in the 1990s and 2000s, menhaden populations began to dwindle. In 2010 stocks hit a 54-year low. In 2013 the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission reduced the quota of commercial menhaden harvest by 20 percent. Spitzer attributes the recent robust East Coast osprey populations to the renewed health of the menhaden fishery following these new rules.\n\n\u201cIt was a huge win,\u201d says Spitzer.\n\nBut now, many ocean conservationists say menhaden are once again coming under intense fishing pressure. In 2015 and 2016, the quota was increased by about 10 percent, and the menhaden quota for 2017 has been increased by about 6 percent from 2016. Some industry representatives are suggesting that the menhaden quota could be raised by up to 30 percent without harming the overall fishery. Spitzer thinks the ASMFC should be more conservative in what it allows so that the menhaden population doesn\u2019t crash again, as it did earlier this decade. He also thinks the continued abundance of menhaden is critical to the continued abundance of ospreys. \n\n\u201cIt is a great blessing to have been able to study ospreys for 50 years and counting. I have observed so many positive outcomes for these birds over the years,\u201d Spitzer says. \u201cDecisions about menhaden now will affect not only fish, but birds, coastal ecosystems and, in the end, every one of us.\u201d", "input": ""}

Safra, a French company that specializes in the renovation of passenger transport equipment and a pioneer inhydrogen mobility, presented a hydrogen coach at the recent UITP Summit that took place in Barcelona last week. The hydrogen retrofitted coach features the company\u2019s H2-PACK kit, which has been designed to convert a combustion-powered intercity coach into a zero-emission vehicle.The H2-PACK retrofit kit is fully designed and assembled by Safra. The retrofit kit allows the vehicle\u2019s diesel engine to be transformed into a zero-emission hydrogen-electric powertrain. The original diesel engine is replaced by a 350 kW Dana electric motor that receives power from a100 kW (70 kW useful) Plastic Omniumfuel cell.According to Safra, the H2 used by the hydrogen coach is stored in six tanks, which have been integrated into an area of the vehicle that is separated from the passengers by a watertight, ventilated and secure partition. The tanks allow for 35 kg of hydrogen to be carried on board, delivering a maximum range of 500 km.The hydrogen coach presented at the event belongs to the Occitanie Region.This is France\u2019s second-largest region by surface area, and it has commissioned Safra with retrofitting 15 of its intercity coaches.Hydrogen Coach H2-PACK \u2013 D-1 to the opening of the UITP Global Public Transport Summit \u2013 Image Credit:SafraThe H2-PACK retrofit offers a number of advantages, but most notably offers economical and ecological benefits. For instance, the cost of converting an existing bus or coach into azero-emission vehicleis much cheaper than buying a brand new vehicle. Additionally, certain on-board components can remain without needing to be reinstalled, such as ticketing equipment, also saving on cost.As for being eco-friendly, the retrofit extends the life of the vehicle, postponing the need for a replacement by several years. Finally, as a hydrogen coach, the same vehicle is able to circulate in LEZ (Low Emissions Zones), which was not possible before.Safra Hycity.Beyond its H2-Pack Retrofit kit, Safra has also manufactured a full-hydrogen bus called the Hycity. So far, about twenty vehicles have been ordered, and the company is continuing to expand its facilities to ramp up production and meet the growing demand from customers eager to establish hydrogen ecosystems.Like the hydrogen coach it retrofitted for the Occitaine Region,Safrawill present its Hycity zero-emission bus at an industry event. \"", "input": ""}

It was another busy day beginning. \n But way off alone, out by himself beyond boat and shore, Jonathan Livingston Seagull was practicing. A hundred feet in the sky he lowered his webbed feet, lifted his beak, and strained to hold a painful hard twisted curve through his wings. The curve meant that he would fly slowly, and now he slowed until the wind was a whisper in his face, until the ocean stood still beneath him. He narrowed his eyes in fierce concentration, held his breath, forced one ... single ... more ... inch ... of ... curve .... Then his feathers ruffled, he stalled and fell. \n Seagulls, as you know, never falter, never stall. To stall in the air is for them disgraced and it is dishonor. \n But Jonathan Livingston Seagull, unashamed, stretching his wings again in that trembling hard curve - slowing, slowing, and stalling once more - was no ordinary bird. \n Most gulls didn't bother to learn more than the simplest facts of flight \u00adhow to get from shore to food and back again. For most gulls, it is not flying that matters, but eating. For this gull, through, it was not eating that mattered, but flight. More than anything else, Jonathan Livingston Seagull loved to fly. \n This kind of thinking, he found, is not the way to make one's self popular with other birds. Even his parents were dismayed as Jonathan spent whole days alone, making hundreds of low-level glides, experimenting. \n He didn't know why, for instance, but when he flew at altitudes less than half his wingspan above the water, he could stay in the air longer, with less effort. His glides ended not with the usual feet-down splash into the sea, but with a long flat wake as he touched the surface with his feet tightly streamlined against his body. When he began sliding in to feet-up landings on the beach, then pacing the length of his slide in the sand, his parents were very much dismayed indeed. \nWhy, Jon, why?\" his mother asked. \"Why is it so hard to be like the rest of the flock, Jon? Why can't you leave low flying to the pelicans, the albatross? \n\"I don't mind being bone and feathers, Mum. I just want to know what I can do in the air and what I can't, that's all. I just want to know.\" \n\"See here, Jonathan,\" said his father, not unkindly. \"Winter isn't far away. Boats will be few, and the surface fish will be swimming deep. If you must study,. then study food, and how to get it. This flying business is all very well, but you can't eat a glide, you know. Don't you forget that the reason you fly is to eat.\"\n Jonathan nodded obediently. For the next few days he tried to be behave like the other gulls; he really tried, screeching and fighting with the flock around the piers and fishing boats, diving on scraps of fish and bread. But he couldn't make it work. \nIt's all so pointless, he thought, deliberately dropping a hard-won anchovy to a hungry old gull chasing him. I could be spending all this time learning to fly. There's so much to learn! \nIt wasn't long before Jonathan Gull was off by himself again, far out at see, hungry, happy, learning. \n The subject was speed, and in a week's practice he learned more about speed than the fastest gull alive. \n From a thousand feet, flapping his wings as hard as he could, he pushed over into a blazing steep dive toward the waves, and learned why seagulls don't make blazing steep power-dives. In just six seconds he was moving seventy miles per hour, the speed at which one's wing goes unstable on the upstroke. \n Time after time it happened. Careful as he was, working at the very peak of his ability, he lost control at high speed. \n Climb to a thousand feet. Full power straight ahead first, then push over, flapping, to a vertical dive. Then, every time, his left wing stalled on an upstroke, he'd roll violently left, stall his right wing recovering, and flick like fire into a wild tumbling spin to the right. \n He couldn't be careful enough on that upstroke. Ten times he tried, but all ten times, as he passed through seventy miles per hour, he burst into a churning mass of feathers, out of control, crashing down into the water. \n They key, he thought as last, dripping wet, must be to hold the wings still \n From two thousand feet he tried again, rolling into his dive, beak straight down, wings full out and stable from the moment he passed fifty miles per hour. It took tremendous strength, but it worked. In ten seconds he has blurred through ninety miles per hour. Jonathan had set a world speed record for seagulls!\n But victory was short-lived. The instant he began his pullout, the instant he changed the angle of his wings, he snapped into that same terrible uncontrolled disaster, and at ninety miles per hour it hit him like dynamite. Jonathan Seagull exploded in midair and smashed down into a brick-hard sea. \n When he came to, it was well after dark, and he floated in moonlight on the surface of the ocean. His wings were ragged bars of lead, but the weight of failure was even heavier on his back. He wished, feebly, that the weight could be just enough to drag him gently down to the bottom, and end it all. \n As he sank low in the water, a strange hollow voice sounded within him. There's no way around it. I am a seagull. I am limited by my nature. If I were meant to learn so much about flying, I'd have a falcon's short wings, and live on mice instead of fish. My father was right. I must forget this foolishness. I must fly home to the Flock and be content as I am, as a poor limited seagull. \n The voice faded, and Jonathan agreed. The place for a seagull at night is on shore, and from this moment forth, he vowed, he would be a normal gull. It would make everyone happier. \n He pushed wearily away from the dark water and flew toward the land, grateful for what he had learned about work-saving low-altitude flying. \n But no, he thought. I am done with the way I was, I am done with everything I learned. I am a seagull like every other seagull, and I will fly like one. So he climbed painfully to a hundred feet and flapped his wings harder, pressing for shore. \n He felt better for his decision to be just another one of the flock. there would be no ties now to the force that had driven him to learn, there would be no more challenge and no more failure. And it was pretty, just to stop thinking, and fly through the dark, toward the lights above the beach. \nDark! The hollow voice cracked in alarm. Seagulls never fly in the dark!\n Jonathan was not alert enough to listen. It's pretty, he thought. The moon and the lights twinkling on the water, throwing out little beacon-trails though the \n Get Down! Seagulls never fly in the dark! If you were meant to fly in the dark, you'd have the eyes f an owl! You'd have charts for brains! You'd have a falcon's short wings!\n There in the night, a hundred feet in the air, Jonathan Livingston Seagull \u00adblinked. His pain, his resolutions, vanished. \n Short Wings. A falcon's short wings!\n That's the answer! What a fool I've been! All I need is a tiny little wing, all I need is to fold most of my wings and fly on just the tips alone! Short wings!\n He climbed two thousand feet above the black sea, and without a moment for thought of failure and death, he brought his forewings tightly in to his body, left only the narrow swept daggers of his wingtips extended into the wind, and fell into a vertical dive. \n The wind was a monster roar at his head. Seventy miles per hour, ninety, a hundred and twenty and faster still. The wing-strain now at a hundred and forty miles per hour wasn't nearly as hard as it had been before at seventy, and with the faintest twist of his wingtips he eased out of the dive and shot above the waves, a grey cannonball under the moon. \n He closed his eyes to slits against the wind and rejoiced. A hundred forty miles per hour! and under control! If I dive from five thousand feet instead of two thousand, I wonder how fast... \n His vows of a moment before were forgotten, swept away in that great swift wind. Yet he felt guiltless, breaking the promises he had made himself. Such promises are only for the gulls that accept the ordinary. One who has touched excellence in his learning has no need of that kind of promise. \n By sunup, Jonathan Gull was practicing again. From five thousand feet the fishing boats were specks in the flat blue water, Breakfast Flock was a faint cloud of dust motes, circling. \n He was alive, trembling ever so slightly with delight, proud that his fear was under control. Then without ceremony he hugged in his forewings, extended his short, angled wingtips, and plunged directly toward the sea. By the time he had passed four thousand feet he had reached terminal velocity, the wind was a solid beating wall of sound against which he could move no faster. He was flying now straight down, at two hundred fourteen miles per hour. He swallowed, knowing that if his wings unfolded at that speed he'd be blown into a million tiny shreds of seagull. But the speed was power, and the", "input": ""}

Both have important roles within ovulation and were thought to be almost interchangeable. Once technology advanced and evolved, researchers were able to study both hormones with better accuracy. Scientists thought this because they share a common receptor, however, this paper explains that there are many differences between these two hormones. The main difference is how they affect the signalling cascade for ovulation. The paper also mentions the hormone GnRH and how it affects LH and hCG. One example of this was when it provided research done on how a GnRH receptor blockade affects LH levels. The differences between LH and hCG were heavily discussed. For instance, the paper provides a diagram and explained how both hormones bind to the same receptor. Finally, the paper gives a brief discussion on what these differences mean for new treatments. Infertility could be treated now that professionals know about these differences a lot better. \n\n3. The usefulness of the reference: This reference was somewhat useful. It provided in depth and incredibly information on the structure, function, and effects of LH. However, how GnRH affects this process was barely discussed. There was some research that was talked about, but It wasn\u2019t enough to expand my knowledge on GnRH a significant amount.

Paragraph summary: Hole\u2019s Essentials of Human Anatomy and Physiology provides a basic summary of the processes that GnRH and luteinizing hormone cause. For example, it explains how GnRh is released from the hypothalamus, and GnRH signals the pituitary gland to secrete LH. LH is used to help ovarian cells produce estrogen. The passage includes other hormones and pathways that cause estrogen to be released. FSH was one such hormone. After explaining the hormones that start the process, the book continues talking about the effects estrogen has. Eventually, it elaborates on the process that lead up to ovulation. Finally, it concludes with explaining how estrogen leads to the inhibition of both LH and FSH. Without directly stating it, the passage explains how GnRH, LH, and estrogen are a negative feedback loop. GnRH stimulates LH which stimulates estrogen. Estrogen then inhibits both GnRH and LH. When estrogen levels eventually lower, both GnRH and LH can be produced. This is how the reproductive cycle of females works. \n\n3. The usefulness of the reference: This reference was extremely useful. It not only explains the interactions that the hormones have on each other, but it also talks about the effects it has on the body. I find this helpful because I didn\u2019t know much on ovulation, so a more in depth explanation of what happens during the process helps immensely. Even outside of this project, this passage provides great surface level knowledge into the topic of ovulation. I would recommend this to someone who needs a starting source on the topic of ovulation. \n\n4.

Paragraph summary: This article discusses gender identity and how humans are taking steps to help the issue. Children who were born biologically male or female may undergo puberty through the wrong body parts. For example, a biological female may go through puberty and testosterone is being produced. These children have to deal with the fact that they live in a body that doesn\u2019t feel natural to them. An option to help the problem is mentioned within the passage. There is a treatment that stops the hormone signalling that causes puberty by regulating GnRH, but the RDA did not approve of it. The treatment that is in use is by using hormone blockers to artificially delay puberty. Suicide rates are higher for people with this issue, and it\u2019s possible that over three million Americans are affected by this. This is why the article makes it clear that there needs to be more progress made in this area. There have been concerns about long term effects such as lowered bone density, infertility, and brain growth. However, no evidence has been presented that proves that any of these are actual effects. \n\n3. The usefulness of the reference: For my personal use, this article is only slightly useful. It does give insight into other scenarios where the hormone pathway that causes puberty is messed up. However, it talks more about the problem and how people are dealing with it than why the hormone pathway is wrong in the first place. It was somewhat useful when the article talked about the health effects of hormone blockers because that could be correlated to the hormones in some way. The article never did correlate it back to the hormones, so all I could do was speculate. This is why I don\u2019t find it extremely useful. That information would be much more beneficial to me than information on children\u2019s hospital that helps these children. For other people, it is a great introduction into the topic of delaying puberty and children who don\u2019t identity if their biological sex. But, that is really the only thing this article can be used for.. \n\n4. Defined vocabulary and key ideas:\n\u201cexperts say there's a fifty-fifty chance your child will attempt suicide before age 20\u201d\n\u201cThe treatment--a series of injections to interrupt the brain cascade that launches puberty by regulating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)--has not yet been submitted for FDA approval for gender-variant children.\u201d\n\u201cThere isn't enough evidence yet to determine the long-term effects of artificially delayed puberty, but the FDA has noted no serious side effects in the nearly 20 years hormone blockers have been used in the U.S. to treat early-onset puberty in the short term.\u201d\n\u201cIf a child doesn't identify with his or her biological sex, the onset of puberty, says Laura Amato, a youth-suicide counselor who runs an online transgender support group, can make that child feel like \"part of a real-life horror story . . . because the wrong parts are changing.\"\u201d\n\n\nEncyclopedia\n1.

First, it explains what the purpose of each is within the human body. For example, the passage explains that LH stimulates testosterone production and sperm maturation in males and theca cells to produce androgens in females. After each has been explained thoroughly, it talks about the feedback loops associated with these hormones. Specifically, the negative feedback loop between GnRH, LH, and FSH and sex steriods. These steroids can mess with how GnRH is released which in turn affects the production of Lh and FSH. Finally, the encyclopedia continues on with explaining how estrogen is affected and ovulation. It explains that estrogen promotes GnRH and LH which leads to ovulation. Also, it describes some of the different subunits to the structures of the proteins. These subunits are important in inhibiting secretion. However, LH levels are not affected by this inhibiting. \n3. The usefulness of the reference: This encyclopedia was fairly helpful. I was able to expand and build upon the foundation that other sources had provided for me on this topic. There were not many other sources that discussed the feedback loops as much as this encyclopedia, so that is why it was so helpful. For other people looking to learn about ovulation, this encyclopedia provides enough information to understand it at a surface level. It doesn;t really deviate from the topic, and if anything, expands the topic even more. \n\n4. Defined vocabulary and key ideas:\n\u201cThe gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), are glycoproteins produced by gonadotrope cells of the anterior pituitary gland.\u201d\n\u201cGonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the brain is the principal stimulator of gonadotropin synthesis and secretion from the pituitary.\u201d\n\u201cIn the brain, these hormones usually slow the release of GnRH through a process called negative feedback, which in turn leads to decreases in FSH and LH.\u201d\n\n\nPopular Source\n1.

This is a test to measure the amount of LH in a person\u2019s blood. First, the video explains what exactly LH causes. For females, ovulation for eggs, and for males, testosterone production. Then, it explains why someone would need to take an LH test. Some of the reasons are to detect when ovulation will take place or if there is a low sperm count. Next, it provides a nice diagram of the progression of signalling that happens. First, GnRH is released from the hypothalamus and signals the Anterior Pituitary to release LH. LH will then go to the testis (male) or ovaries (female). Finally, the video explains the results that a normal LH test should give. The results can vary in females depending on where they are in the menstrual cycle. The video ends with how different levels of LH affect the body of men and men and provides some drugs that can help change these levels. \n\n3. The usefulness of the reference: This reference is fairly useful. The video more so focuses on LH tests and how those results can be interpreted rather than the hormones or ovulation. However, this video did help me understand the basics of ovulation and the hormones involved. I was also given information about LH tests that could be useful later even if it is not apparent right now. This video is great for someone needing more information on LH tests, but I feel there are better sources that focus on ovulation and the hormones involved more. \n\n4.

The consequences of a warming planet are far-reaching, with significant implications for global biodiversity and ecosystems. This research paper presents a comprehensive review of the scientific literature to assess the impact of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystems. Through the synthesis of recent findings, we explore the mechanisms by which climate change affects various species, communities, and the broader environment. Additionally, we discuss the potential mitigation strategies and policy implications to safeguard the fragile balance of nature.\n\n1. Introduction:\nClimate change is a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, in the Earth's atmosphere due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. The impacts of climate change extend beyond temperature increases; they also encompass shifts in precipitation patterns, more frequent extreme weather events, and rising sea levels. These changes have far-reaching effects on the Earth's ecosystems, posing severe challenges to biodiversity.\n\n2. Climate Change and Species Distribution:\nIn this section, we explore the impacts of climate change on species distribution and migration patterns. As the climate shifts, many species are forced to adapt or migrate to more suitable habitats. We examine the consequences of these shifts, including altered predator-prey dynamics, competition for resources, and potential loss of species unable to adapt or relocate in time.\n\n3. Climate Change and Phenological Shifts:\nChanges in seasonal patterns due to climate change influence the timing of critical ecological events such as flowering, breeding, and migration. We investigate the phenological shifts observed in different ecosystems and their cascading effects on ecosystem functioning and trophic interactions.\n\n4. Ocean Acidification and Coral Reef Ecosystems:\nThe increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide leads to ocean acidification, which severely impacts marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs. We delve into the mechanisms behind ocean acidification, its effects on coral calcification and growth, and the implications for the rich biodiversity that depends on coral reef habitats.\n\n5. Climate Change and Polar Regions:\nPolar regions are experiencing the most rapid warming, with profound consequences for polar ecosystems and species like polar bears, penguins, and seals. We analyze the impacts of melting ice caps, shifts in food availability, and potential range contractions for species adapted to these extreme environments.\n\n6. Climate Change and Forests:\nForests play a crucial role in sequestering carbon dioxide, but they are also vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as increased droughts, wildfires, and pest infestations. We explore the intricate relationships between climate change, forests, and the implications for biodiversity and carbon storage.\n\n7. Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies:\nTo mitigate the impact of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystems, various strategies are being proposed and implemented. This section highlights the significance of conservation efforts, sustainable land-use practices, and the promotion of renewable energy sources. Additionally, we discuss the importance of fostering resilience in ecosystems to facilitate their adaptation to the changing climate.\n\n8. Policy Implications:\nEffective policies and international cooperation are crucial to combat climate change and protect biodiversity. We analyze existing policies and international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, and suggest potential improvements to enhance global efforts in addressing this multifaceted challenge.\n\n9. Conclusion:\nThis research paper highlights the pervasive impact of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystems worldwide. It emphasizes the urgency of implementing adaptive and mitigative measures to safeguard the delicate balance of nature. By fostering a deeper understanding of the interconnections between climate change and the environment, we can strive towards a more sustainable and resilient future for all life on Earth.\n\nReferences:\n[List of cited literature and studies used in the research paper.]"}
