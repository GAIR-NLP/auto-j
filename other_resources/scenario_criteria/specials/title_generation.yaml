  style:
    content: For different kinds of text (e.g., news, blog, academic paper, etc.), the writing style of the generated title should be appropriate. You should clearly identify the type of text and the user's requirements. For example, if the text is a news article, the title should be short and concise, and it should be written in a journalistic style. If the text is a blog post, the title should be catchy and interesting, and it should be written in a casual style. If the text is an academic paper, the title should be formal and professional, and it should be written in an academic style.
